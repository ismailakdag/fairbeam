# Fairbeam

**The open electromagnetic workbench.** Design, simulate and document antennas and RF circuits on
the open-source [openEMS](https://openems.de) FDTD solver, from a ribbon-based 3D designer or from
parametric Python models.

## Download

The desktop app is free, for **macOS** (Apple silicon, signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple) and **Windows** x64.
Get the latest version from
[fairbeam-releases](https://github.com/ismailakdag/fairbeam-releases/releases/latest). The app
installs its own runtime (Python and openEMS) for your user on first start and offers updates for you to install.
[Getting started](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) takes you from installing to reading the results of a
patch antenna.

The Windows installer is not code-signed. SmartScreen may show "Windows protected
your PC": choose **More info › Run anyway**. The macOS app is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple. The
[browser demo](https://fairbeam.org/app/) opens the example projects read-only, without installing
anything.

## What it does

- **Designer.** Draw parametric solids and sheets, use Boolean operations, transforms and a working
  coordinate system, add ports and lumped elements, check the model, mesh it and run it, in one
  window ([designer guide](docs/DESIGNER.md)).
- **Simulation.** openEMS on the CPU, or the optional GPU engine (Metal on Apple silicon, CUDA on
  NVIDIA cards). Automatic meshing, mesh convergence, parameter sweeps and a goal-driven optimizer
  ([meshing](docs/MESHING.md), [run server](docs/RUN-SERVER.md), [optimizer](docs/OPTIMIZE.md),
  [GPU engine](docs/GPU.md)).
- **Results.** S-parameters with markers, impedance, VSWR, Smith and polar charts, 2D and 3D
  far-field patterns (directivity, gain, realized gain, efficiency), surface currents and field
  planes, multi-port S-matrices and arrays with beam steering. Supported result plots provide data tables and run
  comparisons ([results](docs/RESULTS.md), [multi-port](docs/MULTIPORT.md),
  [arrays](docs/ARRAYS.md)).
- **Python models and CLI.** One Python file per antenna or circuit, with templates; the `fairbeam`
  CLI runs, sweeps, converges and optimizes them ([writing models](docs/MODELS.md),
  [CLI](docs/CLI.md)).
- **Outputs.** B&W technical drawings, publication figures, a PDF report and an export package;
  Touchstone and CSV; STL, glTF and Blender scenes, with optional rendered images; fabrication files
  (Gerber X2, Excellon, DXF; preview) ([exports](docs/EXPORTS.md)).
- **File compatibility.** CST-compatible VBA macro export (`.bas`) and macro import (`.bas`,
  `.mcs`, `.txt`) ([designer guide](docs/DESIGNER.md#importing-a-vba-macro)).

## Open and reproducible

Fairbeam supports reproducible workflows through recorded inputs, versioned bundles and documented export formats:
- **Findable** results: versioned, self-describing project bundles that record the generator, the
  versions and the run settings (`fairbeam.project/1`).
- **Accessible:** open formats and no licence server.
- **Interoperable:** Touchstone, CSV, STL, glTF, Gerber/Excellon and VBA macros.
- **Reusable:** GPL-3.0-or-later project models with recorded inputs; third-party models retain their own terms.

Results are checked against analytical references ([validation](docs/VALIDATION.md),
[how results are computed](docs/RESULTS.md)).

## Status

Fairbeam 0.7 is a development release. The Python pipeline, the designer and the desktop app work
end to end on macOS (Apple silicon) and on Windows 11. The project file format is versioned, and
breaking changes bump its version. The fabrication outputs
have not yet been checked by a fab. Known gaps and plans are in
[the roadmap](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#roadmap).

## Use and limitations

Fairbeam is shared to support education, research and open-source collaboration, without warranties.
Results may contain errors and should be independently verified through mesh-convergence checks
and suitable analytical references or measurements. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the authors and contributors accept no liability for losses arising from its use; see
[LICENSE](LICENSE), sections 15–17. This statement does not restrict uses permitted by the license,
including commercial use. See [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for tested cases and their limits.

## Privacy

Since Fairbeam 0.7.2, the desktop app asks once whether you want to help count installs. Counting
is off until you choose **Allow**; **No thanks** or dismissing the dialog keeps it off. Sign-in
remains disabled. With consent, the app sends a random install ID, app version, operating system,
CPU architecture and report schema to `fairbeam.org/api/ping`, at most once every seven days.
Designs, files and simulation results are not included. You can turn counting off at any time in
**Settings > General > Install counts**, which deletes the local install ID and stops future
install-count requests. `FAIRBEAM_NO_TELEMETRY=1` also disables counting for that process.

Update checks contact GitHub (fairbeam-releases); app and runtime downloads come from GitHub and
upstream hosts. The website and install-count API are hosted on Vercel. Hosting providers see your
IP address and request data; their own policies govern infrastructure logs. See the
[privacy notice](https://fairbeam.org/privacy.html) for the controller, purpose, processors,
retention, rights and international processing details. For privacy questions or rights requests,
contact ismail@fairbeam.org. Do not post personal information in public issues.

## From source

Requirements: Python 3.10+, Node.js 22.12.0+ and an openEMS build. On macOS (and Linux) a script builds
openEMS for you:

```bash
scripts/install-openems-macos.sh                              # openEMS + CSXCAD into ~/opt/openEMS
~/opt/openEMS/venv/bin/fairbeam run python/models/patch_antenna.py
npm install
npm run serve &   # the run server on port 5320 (Run panel, sweeps, optimizer)
npm run dev       # the viewer and designer on http://127.0.0.1:5310
```

- Windows: [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md).
- The desktop app: [docs/DESKTOP.md](docs/DESKTOP.md).
- Everything else, including the test suite: [docs/FROM-SOURCE.md](docs/FROM-SOURCE.md).

## Contributing and feedback

- Found a problem or missing something? Use **Help › Report a problem** in the app, or open an
  issue at [fairbeam-releases](https://github.com/ismailakdag/fairbeam-releases/issues). The app
  fills in the version and the operating system.
- Code and documentation contributions are welcome as pull requests here. Read
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
- Fairbeam is developed with AI coding assistance. How that works, and the rules for AI-assisted
  contributions, are in the [AI policy](AI_POLICY.md).
