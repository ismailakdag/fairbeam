# Sweeps, convergence studies and Touchstone export

Three CLI commands build on `fairbeam run`: `sweep`, `converge` and `touchstone`. The code is in
`python/fairbeam/study.py` and `python/fairbeam/touchstone.py`.

## `fairbeam sweep`

```bash
fairbeam sweep python/models/dipole.py --param length=50,58,66 --threads 4
fairbeam sweep python/models/inset_patch.py --param inset=6,8,10 --param feed_w=2.6,3.0 --set f_max=3.5
```

- Each `--param KEY=V1,V2,...` adds an axis. Several axes form a **cartesian** grid, iterated with
  the last axis fastest.
- `--set KEY=VALUE` fixes other parameters for every point.
- Every point is validated against the model's `PARAMS` (type, min, max) **before** any solver time
  is spent.
- Points run **sequentially**, one openEMS process at a time. `--threads` defaults to 4.
- Each point is a normal bundle, written to `<out>/studies/<name>/<slug>.json`.
- The study summary is written to `<out>/studies/<name>.json`. `<out>` defaults to `public/projects`,
  and `<name>` defaults to `<model-id>--sweep--<axes>`.
- Member bundles are **not** added to the gallery index (`public/projects/index.json`), so a
  20-point sweep does not flood it. Open a member directly, or load the study file.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--param KEY=V1,V2,...` | required | Sweep axis (repeatable) |
| `--set KEY=VALUE` | | Fixed override (repeatable) |
| `--name NAME` | derived | Study name |
| `--out DIR` | `public/projects` | Projects folder; the study goes to `DIR/studies` |
| `--sim-root DIR` | `.sim` | Raw openEMS output (`.sim/<study>/<slug>`) |
| `--threads N` | `4` | FDTD threads |
| `--points N` | `801` | Frequency points |
| `--pattern "2.4,5.8"` | band centers | Far-field frequencies in GHz |
| `--end-db DB` | model default | Energy end criterion, for example `-60` |
| `--no-exact` | off | Check the end criterion every ~4 s of wall time instead of every Nyquist period. The exact check (machine-independent stop; openEMS `--exact-endcriteria`) is the default; the old `--exact` flag is still accepted and does nothing |
| `--engine cpu\|gpu` | `cpu` (or `$FAIRBEAM_ENGINE`) | FDTD engine |
| `--excite all\|1,3` | all ports if <= 4, else 1 | Ports driven per point (one run each) for multi-port models |
| `--verbose` | off | Echo openEMS output |

### RunHistory sweep CSV

In the Run panel, expand a parameter sweep and choose **Compare all**, then **Export CSV**
or **Copy data**. Both use the same long table, with one row per job, including unfinished and
failed jobs. The columns are `run_index`, `sequence_index`, `sequence_name`, `status`, the sweep
parameter keys, `band_lo_ghz`, `band_hi_ghz`, `band_center_ghz`, `band_best_ghz`, `s11_min_db`,
`dmax_dbi`, and `radiation_efficiency_pct`. Band values describe the first matched band; far-field
values describe the first far-field frequency. Unavailable values are blank.

`band_center_ghz` is the middle of the band edges, `(band_lo_ghz + band_hi_ghz) / 2`;
`band_best_ghz` is the frequency of minimum |S11|. Previously, `band_center_ghz` held that minimum.
Older job stats without both edges leave the center blank while retaining the best-match frequency.
The RunHistory table labels its minimum-frequency column **Best match**. These CSV columns are
separate from the CLI study JSON format below, whose `f_center` remains the minimum frequency.

## `fairbeam converge`

### A design: mesh density

```bash
fairbeam converge python/models/my_patch.design.json --densities 15,20,30,40 --max-runs 4 --engine gpu
```

With a `.design.json` and no `--param`, the design runs at each automatic-mesh density in turn
(`mesh.cells_per_wavelength`; in the Auto mode its `cells_per_wavelength` override). After each run
it compares the resonance (S11 minimum), |S11| there, Dmax (with a far field) and the input
impedance with the previous run, and stops at the first step whose changes are all strictly below
`--tol-f` (0.5 %), `--tol-s11` (1 dB) and `--tol-dmax` (0.2 dB), or after `--max-runs` (4) runs. The
code is in `python/fairbeam/convergence.py`; the options are in [CLI.md](CLI.md). Output:

```
 cells/λ      cells   f_res GHz     df %   S11 dB    dS11  Dmax dBi   dD dB           Zin ohm   time s  ok
      15      55104      2.4495        -   -42.35       -      6.76       -         49.7-0.4j      1.1
      20     101088      2.4538    0.173   -41.34    1.02      6.75  -0.003         49.8-0.5j      1.2  no

tolerances: |df| < 0.5 %, |dS11| < 1 dB, |dDmax| < 0.2 dB
converged at 20 cells/λ
```

The designer's Mesh convergence… dialog runs the same study through the run server
(`POST /api/convergence`, one run job per density, the next one queued only when the rule says to
continue; `GET /api/convergence/{id}` returns the study file below, `POST /api/sweeps/{id}/cancel`
stops it). See [DESIGNER.md](DESIGNER.md#mesh-convergence).

The study file has `kind: "mesh-convergence"`; `axes` lists the densities that ran, and
`convergence` holds the rule's state:

```json
{
  "schema": "fairbeam.study/1", "kind": "mesh-convergence", "id": "cv-20260928-101500-ab12",
  "name": "Patch · mesh convergence",
  "axes": [{"key": "mesh.cells_per_wavelength", "values": [15, 20, 30]}],
  "members": [
    {"density": 15, "status": "done", "file": "patch--mesh-15.json",
     "metrics": {"f_res": 2.4495e9, "s11_db": -42.35, "dmax_dbi": 6.756, "zin_re": 49.7, "zin_im": -0.4,
                 "matched": true, "cells": 55104, "timesteps": 14016, "wall_time_s": 1.1}, "summary": {"...": "..."}}
  ],
  "convergence": {
    "tolerances": {"f_pct": 0.5, "s11_db": 1.0, "dmax_db": 0.2}, "densities": [15, 20, 30], "max_runs": 3,
    "steps": [{"from": 15, "to": 20, "df_pct": 0.173, "ds11_db": 1.02, "ddmax_db": -0.003, "dzin_ohm": 0.14,
               "ok": {"f": true, "s11": false, "dmax": true}, "converged": false}],
    "converged": true, "converged_at": 20, "done": true, "reason": "converged",
    "verdict": "converged at 20 cells/λ", "next": null
  }
}
```

- `converged_at` is the coarser density of the first converged step; the finer run confirms it.
- `reason` is `converged`, `exhausted` (no density left: "not converged: refine further or check
  the model"), `failed`, `cancelled` or `running` (then `next` is the density queued next).
- Reopening a previously successful Design report without verified energy and local-mesh checks returns
  `reason: "unverified"`, clears the recommended density and retains the old claim in
  `recorded_verdict`. The saved file is preserved; rerun the study to establish current evidence.
- `ok.dmax` is `null` when a run has no far field; Dmax then does not count.
- The resonance is refined between frequency samples (a parabola through the S11 minimum and its
  neighbors in dB), so the grid spacing does not dominate a 0.5 % tolerance.

### A Python model: a mesh parameter

```bash
fairbeam converge python/models/dipole.py --param mesh_div=10,15,20,30 --end-db -60
fairbeam converge python/models/sierpinski_monopole.py --set iterations=2 --param cell=0.8,0.6,0.45
```

This is a thin wrapper around `sweep` with exactly one axis, which you list **from coarse to fine**.
Between successive refinements it reports:

- the change of the **first resonance**: the center (S11 minimum) of the first band below −10 dB,
  or the global S11 minimum if nothing is matched
- the change of **Dmax** at the far-field frequency closest to that resonance
- the change of **S11 depth** at that resonance, including studies started with `--param`

A step counts as converged when |Δf| < `--tol-f` (default 0.5 %), |ΔS11| < `--tol-s11`
(default 1 dB) and available |ΔDmax| < `--tol-d` (default 0.1 dB). Both runs must meet the
energy-decay criterion and have no reported unresolved fine features. Missing S11 depth does not
pass. The study is converged when its **last** step is. These checks do not replace two further
local refinements when the port cells stay fixed as the global mesh parameter changes.

Historical output below predates the S11-depth guard; the current table also shows `dS11 dB`:

```
  mesh_div      cells   f_res GHz      df %  Dmax dBi    dD dB  ok
        15      50544      2.4100         -      6.80        -
        20      97152      2.4325     0.934      6.81    0.010  no
        30     263568      2.4525     0.822      6.79   -0.021  no
        40     535920      2.4550     0.102      6.79   -0.002  yes
converged (last step |df| < 0.5 %, |dD| < 0.1 dB): YES
```

Refine the parameter that controls the mesh on the metal (`mesh_div`, `cell`, ...), not only the
global cell size. See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md#5-recommended-settings).

### Separate feed refinement from the global mesh

The patch example retains its original ideal line feed by default (`feed_width=0`). For a
**different, explicitly finite source model**, set `feed_width` in mm and refine `feed_cells`
across that fixed square footprint. This is a distributed lumped source, not a coaxial connector.
Also refine `sub_cells` through the substrate and raise `max_timesteps` when a smaller cell
reduces the stable timestep. Keep the physical footprint, material, boundaries and source fixed.

From `python/`, the following optional experiment runs four sequential CPU solves, with a
1 × 1 mm footprint and 2, 4, 8, 16 cells across the footprint and substrate:

```bash
python -m tests.patch_feed_study --out /path/to/new-patch-study
```

It saves raw complex S11, dense samples around the patch minimum, mesh lines, solver logs and
two successive refinement checks. Passing a frequency-only test does not establish stable match
depth. Converting an ideal line-feed example to a Design freezes `feed_width`: changing a line
to an area requires new mesh anchors. Convert with a positive width override if the Design must
retain an editable finite footprint.

The Windows CPU control on October 8, 2026 reached −60 dB energy decay at all four levels:

| Feed / substrate cells | S11 minimum (GHz) | Depth (dB) | Depth change (dB) | Maximum complex S11 change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 2.44700 | −35.630 | — | — |
| 4 | 2.45395 | −33.521 | 2.109 | 0.11322 |
| 8 | 2.45580 | −32.885 | 0.636 | 0.03220 |
| 16 | 2.45645 | −32.564 | 0.321 | 0.01084 |

The last frequency change was 0.0265%, but the full-band complex change still exceeded the
predeclared 0.01 limit. Frequency and minimum depth met their individual limits on the last two
steps; two successive passes of **all three criteria** were not obtained. The finite
source is an explicit modeling option, not a validated replacement for the line feed or a
correction for other antennas. Compact inputs, criteria and measurements are retained in
`python/tests/fixtures/patch_finite_feed_20261008.json`; the command above recreates the raw data.

### Blade: declare the source before judging the mesh

The Blade is a retired synthetic gallery geometry with no measured antenna or specified connector.
It is no longer shipped in the gallery or desktop examples. Its source is retained only at
`python/tests/fixtures/blade_retired.design.json` for regression tests and explicit research replay.
An ideal line port and a finite-width planar gap source are different models. Their different
S11 curves do not by themselves establish physical accuracy. Keep the width fixed while
refining its mesh; do not tune geometry to hide source sensitivity.

The October 8, 2026 control retained the same PEC blade, ground, band, 50 Ω reference and
full-precision interior mesh. Extending the PML box by 8 and then 16 edge-width cells per side
passed both successive checks (maximum complex S11 changes 0.000504 and 0.000389).
The separate feed study inserted local midpoints twice, within x/y ±4 mm and z −2 to 6 mm.
Only the second source model spreads the port across the existing 4 mm tab; it has no coaxial pin.

| Source | Refinement level | S11 minimum (GHz) | Minimum (dB) | S11 at 867 MHz (dB) | Maximum successive complex change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ideal line | 0 | 0.919597 | -14.768 | -14.036 | — |
| Ideal line | 1 | 0.919972 | -13.982 | -13.308 | 0.030059 |
| Ideal line | 2 | 0.920203 | -13.315 | -12.689 | 0.028877 |
| 4 mm planar | 0 | 0.916355 | -17.316 | -16.427 | — |
| 4 mm planar | 1 | 0.916450 | -17.137 | -16.266 | 0.004309 |
| 4 mm planar | 2 | 0.916494 | -17.038 | -16.177 | 0.002567 |

The line source did not pass. The fixed-width source **passed** both successive local checks.
Each step requires a frequency change below 0.5%, minimum-depth and 867 MHz changes below
0.5 dB, and maximum complex S11 difference below 0.01 over 0.7–1.05 GHz. All cases must also
reach −60 dB energy decay, pass the reflected-power limit of 1.001 and retain a minimum inside
the fixed 0.85–1.00 GHz tracking window. Frequency agreement alone is not sufficient.

From `python/`, run one study at a time, using a fresh output directory:

```bash
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase boundary --width 0 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-boundary
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase feed --width 0 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-line
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase feed --width 4 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-planar
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase auto --width 4 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-auto
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase auto --width 4 --densities 40 50 60 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-fine
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase auto --width 4 --densities 40 60 80 --air-density 20 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-fixed-air
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase auto --width 4 --densities 60 80 100 --air-density 20 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-final
python -m tests.blade_feed_study --phase auto --width 4 --densities 20 30 40 --air-density 20 --threads 12 --out /path/to/new-blade-footprint
```

The frozen source is `python/tests/fixtures/blade_feed_base.design.json`. `--phase auto` instead
builds automatic meshes at 20, 30 and 40 cells per wavelength; this checks that configuration,
including its derived outer box, rather than only the frozen grid. Each case is capped at eight
million cells and 5,400 seconds. Results include exact input, raw voltage/current probes,
complex S11 CSV, mesh, energy and acceptance records. Finishing the command is not a
convergence certificate: inspect `comparison.json` for two successive passes.

`--densities` selects a prospective three-level sequence. `--air-density 20` keeps the outer
air density fixed while refining the feature mesh. Without it, both densities change together.
The 20/30/40 and 40/50/60 sequences did not establish two successive passes: their largest
complex changes were 0.01767 and 0.01448. With air density fixed at 20, the 40→60 change was
0.01014 (still above the unchanged 0.01 limit), while 60→80 passed at 0.00448. All failed
steps are retained in the evidence; stable minimum frequency alone does not override them.
The next 80→100 change also failed (0.01521). Historical automatic controls are reproducible
from commit `be2e5d1`, before the footprint fix; use the final command on the current code.

The investigation found a separate mesh-reporting defect: a 4 mm-wide source occupied one
4 mm transverse cell, yet its feed was marked resolved because only the flat transverse axis
was checked. The corrected check and refinement cover the whole source footprint. It passed
the geometric regression checks; the subsequent 20→30→40 test passed its first step (0.00567)
but failed its second (0.02866 complex S11, 0.689 dB minimum-depth change). This is **not**
a full S11-convergence solution. Blade was therefore removed from the shipped examples.
The retained research fixture keeps its ideal-line default and experimental `feed_fraction` option.

Measured summaries, input/output hashes and limits are in
`python/tests/fixtures/blade_source_study_20261008.json`. Runs used openEMS 0.37.0rc3,
CSXCAD 0.7.0rc3, a Ryzen 9 7900X and 32 GiB RAM on Windows 11, with 12 CPU threads.
The reused line-source half-grid case used four threads: normalized inputs matched exactly,
and a four/twelve-thread baseline response check had zero difference. Times are not a speed
benchmark. These local tests do not establish physical accuracy, far-field convergence or GPU parity.

### Compare with an independently installed openEMS CLI

```bash
python -m tests.native_gallery_study --native /path/to/openEMS --out /path/to/new-control --timeout 15000
```

This optional, long-running control covers the Python examples, saved example Designs and the
iteration-zero Sierpinski variant. Use `--models dipole,wideband_dipole_867` for a subset. It runs every port
sequentially in both routes, on four CPU threads, with identical full-precision CSXCAD geometry,
mesh and −60 dB energy criterion, with a 300,000-step cap overriding the model's limit.
It retains raw waves, full S matrices, solver input, model
source, hashes and logs. Native input uses 17-digit primitive coordinates to avoid displacing
flat sources relative to their mesh when serializing CSXCAD XML.

The full gallery can take hours. The command raises the per-native-solve timeout from 900 to
15,000 seconds for the larger examples; a pair gets twice that budget plus 50 seconds.
`--threads N` changes the CPU thread count in both routes without changing the physical input.
Use a new output directory for each attempt; interrupted outputs are retained.

The checks distinguish equal-input agreement, energy completion, matrix passivity, S-matrix
assembly and result-storage rounding. They omit far fields and do not establish mesh convergence
or physical accuracy. An independently extracted executable can still contain the same upstream
solver binary as the app; compare its library hash and record that fact.

The October 8, 2026 Windows CPU control completed all 21 gallery cases/variants in 64 sequential
solver runs, using four or 12 threads, matched within each pair. All raw complex S matrices
agreed exactly; the largest independent assembly difference was 5.58e-16 and the largest bundle
rounding difference was 7.05e-6. All cases met the energy and matrix-passivity limits. The 136
voltage/current probe pairs also matched at their saved precision. The app and official archive
contained the same openEMS DLL: this establishes agreement between two execution paths, not
agreement with an independent solver or physical measurements. CPU inputs, binary/source hashes,
criteria and per-case results are in `python/tests/fixtures/native_gallery_control_20261008.json`.
GPU execution and far fields were not tested by this control.
The full-gallery fixture records the earlier Blade line-source model; its source hashes are
part of the evidence. It must not be presented as a replay of a later edited source.
The historical 21-case total includes the now-retired Blade. Current default gallery runs exclude
it; `--models blade_867` explicitly selects the retained research fixture when needed.

The refreshed Blade source was checked again on October 9 with 12 CPU threads in both routes,
the same −60 dB/300,000-step control and no far-field calculation. Raw complex S11 and saved
voltage/current records agreed exactly; the maximum bundle-rounding difference was 6.87e-6.
Energy and passivity checks passed. The source hash and measurements are under
`new_gallery_native_control` in `python/tests/fixtures/blade_source_study_20261008.json`.
This is execution parity with the same upstream DLL, not evidence of Blade mesh convergence.

- `members[].file` is relative to the projects folder, so the viewer can fetch `/projects/<file>`.
- `members[].params` holds the swept values as given on the command line (strings).
- Frequencies are in Hz.
- `summary.converged` is the **solver** end-criterion status of that run. `convergence` is the mesh
  study result.
- `sparams` (multi-port models only) is `{f, db: {"i,j": |S_ij| in dB}, reciprocity_max, passive}` at
  the first resonance frequency, or `null`.
- `reactance_zeros` lists the frequencies where Im(Zin) crosses zero upward (series resonances),
  with Re(Zin) there. They do not depend on the port reference impedance, which makes them the
  best numbers to compare with other solvers.
- `convergence` is present for `kind: "convergence"` (a `--param` refinement) and, with a different
  layout (see above), for `kind: "mesh-convergence"`. It has one step per consecutive pair of members.
- Only with the opt-in `--network-metric` / `--network-frequency` criteria (see [CLI.md](CLI.md)):
  the study has `network_criteria`, each member's `summary.network` (`--param`) or
  `metrics.network` (design) holds the fixed-frequency values, and every convergence step has a
  `network` object whose verdict is ANDed into its `converged`. Without the options these fields are
  absent and the verdicts are unchanged.

## `fairbeam touchstone`

```bash
fairbeam touchstone public/projects/patch-antenna.json              # -> public/projects/patch-antenna.s1p
fairbeam touchstone public/projects/dipole.json -o dipole.s1p --ref 0   # keep the 73 ohm port reference
```

For a one-port bundle, or with `--port N`, this writes a Touchstone v1 `.s1p` file with the header
`# GHz S RI R 50`. For a multi-port bundle it writes the full matrix as `.s<N>p`, which needs every
port to have been excited (`--excite all`, the default for up to 4 ports). The 2-port file is
column-wise on one line per frequency (S11 S21 S12 S22), as the v1 format requires; N ≥ 3 is written
row by row with at most four complex pairs per line. Ports with different reference impedances are
renormalised exactly to `--ref`. openEMS measures S11
against the lumped port's own resistance. For a one-port the reflection coefficient is renormalised
**exactly** to any reference through the input impedance, `S' = (Zin − Z) / (Zin + Z)`. The default
is 50 Ω, so the file imports into ADS or scikit-rf without surprises.
Waveguide data use the actual per-frequency positive real references, not their band-center
summary. The full multi-port power-wave transform also handles unequal references; it does not
renormalize matrix entries independently. Invalid references or ambiguous physical port mappings
are refused before an existing output file is opened.

`--ref 0` keeps the native reference only when it is constant across frequency and, for a full
matrix, common to every port. A varying waveguide reference cannot be represented by the single
Touchstone v1 header: choose a positive `--ref` instead (the default is 50 Ω). In the Python API,
`z_ref=None` has the same keep-native rule. `--port N` selects a port; the default is the excited
port. This converts the interchange data, not the stored simulation results.

To read Touchstone files in Python, use `fairbeam.touchstone.read_snp(path)` (returns `(f_hz, S, z0)`)
or `read_touchstone(path)`, which also returns the warnings. It reads v1 and v2 files. Y/Z data
are converted to S, per-port v2 references are renormalised to one impedance, and noise blocks
are skipped. It uses the same rules as the viewer's importer.
