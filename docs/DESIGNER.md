# The designer

The designer is Fairbeam's visual modeling workspace, laid out as a one-row ribbon
over the 3D view, the navigation tree on the left, the properties of the selection on the right, a
dock with the checks, the parameters and the progress of a run at the bottom, and a status bar. The
results of a run open as tabs beside the 3D view. You draw or add shapes, give them materials,
place ports, set up the simulation, run openEMS and read the results without leaving the model.

A design is a data file, `<name>.design.json`, not Python. Everything else in Fairbeam (the CLI,
sweeps, the optimizer, the Run panel) treats a design like any model, and you can export it as a
Python model file at any time.

The designer needs the run server (`fairbeam serve`, see [RUN-SERVER.md](RUN-SERVER.md)). The
desktop app ([DESKTOP.md](DESKTOP.md)) starts it for you. The public demo is read-only and has no
designer.

## Start screen

![Start screen: a new design, your designs, the Python models and the examples](designer/start.png)

The start screen opens when the run server is reachable. It has three parts:

- **New design**: a name (filled in from the starting point until you type your own) and a starting point. The file name follows from the name
  (`Dual-band patch` → `dual_band_patch.design.json`). "Empty design" gives a band (f0 × 0.6 to
  1.4, MUR boundaries, −50 dB end criterion), copper (no dielectric: Materials › Add dielectric copies FR4 or another library material when a substrate is needed), and no geometry. The starters are
  small parametric designs, grouped as Basic antennas, Printed and Circuits (see
  [Starters](#starters) below). **Create and open the designer** makes the file and opens it.
  **Import VBA macro…** makes a design from a CST-compatible VBA macro or history list (`.bas`, `.mcs`, `.txt`) instead (see
  [Importing a VBA macro](#importing-a-vba-macro)); **Import PCB artwork…** does so from DXF or
  Gerber files (see [Importing PCB artwork](#importing-pcb-artwork-dxfgerber)).
- **Your designs**: search by name, ID, or filename, sort by name or recent modification, and star
  favorite designs. Favorites appear first and the favorites filter and sort choice are remembered
  in this browser. Older entries without a modification timestamp use their name as a fallback.
  Open one in the designer. Right-click a saved design (or press Shift+F10 while its row is focused)
  to **Rename** its display name or **Show in File Explorer** in the desktop app. Renaming keeps
  its file, ID and existing results, and offers **Undo** on Start; save an open design's edits first.
  The bin icon deletes a design after a confirmation;
  the file moves to the model history folder, so it can be restored. A design file that does not
  open (damaged, or made by a newer Fairbeam) stays in the list, grayed, with the reason.
- **Python models** and **Examples**: open a model in the Run panel, or an example with its
  results (in Examples mode). **Open as new design…** next to an example makes an editable
  design of your own from it. The runs of your designs are not listed here: they open under the
  design (see [Running and results](#running-and-results)).

The footer's **Send feedback** links open the public issue tracker in your browser; see
[Feedback](#feedback).

Start lists your own Python models first, then the bundled examples' models, marked *example,
read-only*: a click opens one in the Run panel (a bundled one asks to copy it or to run it as it is),
and its copy button makes an editable design of it. On Start, the header's **Run a Python model…**
scrolls to this list. The Examples card groups the examples like the header's picker, with their
bands and mesh sizes. A new design's file name is the ASCII form of its name; a name that is a
bundled example's ID gets a number (Patch antenna is saved as `patch_antenna_2.design.json`), as the
line under the Name field shows. **Save as…** (Home ribbon › Project, the header's More menu,
Shift+Ctrl+S or ⇧⌘S where the browser leaves it to the page, and File › Save As in the desktop app)
saves a copy of the open design under a new name.

The header's **Start · Design · Examples** switch moves between the start screen, the designer and
the examples:

The header's **More** menu keeps secondary actions available with arrow-key navigation and Escape.
**Open result or design file…** is available there and through desktop **File → Open**: a result
file (`.json` of a run) opens in Examples; a design file (`.design.json`, e.g. Export › Current
design JSON from a colleague) is created as a new design in the workspace, under a free file name
from its name, and opened in Design. Dropping either on the window does the same. Opening a design
lists its saved runs under **Results** in the tree; select a run to view it without opening a file
manually.
On narrow windows the tree and properties panels share one overlay slot so they do not cover
both sides of the canvas at once. Resizing back restores the independently remembered desktop
panel choices. General Settings and About take focus whenever opened; dialogs contain Tab,
isolate the background, and restore focus when closed. Escape closes the top dialog unless an
inner control handles it first.

- **Design** owns its runs. They are listed under Results in the navigation tree and open in place:
  the 3D view shows the run's geometry with its pattern or surface currents, the dock its plots.
- **Examples** is the viewer described in the [README](../README.md) and [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md),
  on the example projects: the bundled ones, with their results ready, and your runs of the Python
  models. The searchable project picker in the header (type to filter, grouped by model) lists
  them; the runs of your designs are not among them. **Open as new design…** (next to the picker,
  and in the model panel) makes an editable design from the open example; it is disabled, with the
  reason as its tooltip, for an example the design format cannot hold or a project that is not a
  bundled example. **Open in designer** appears in the model panel when the project was simulated
  from one of your designs. Without the run server (the public demo) every project is an example,
  and Design stays unavailable.

  **What the copy of a Python example contains.** The dialog's note lists it. The example is built at
  the values of the open project (its defaults for the bundled ones) and read back as shapes,
  materials, ports, band, boundaries and its own mesh lines (rounded to 1e-6 mm). Identical metals
  share one material (the parts keep their names). The example's **parameters** come along: Fairbeam
  rebuilds the example with each numeric parameter moved a little (two builds per parameter at most,
  one for a parameter that changes nothing) and every coordinate or value that is an exact linear
  function of the parameters (within 1e-9) is written as an expression: the patch example's patch
  box becomes `-patch_w/2, -patch_l/2, sub_h` to `patch_w/2, patch_l/2, sub_h`, its permittivity
  `eps_r`, its feed `feed_x`. The copy can then be swept and optimized by these parameters like a
  design of your own. Mesh lines that sit on such a coordinate follow it, and the lines between two
  of them keep their place proportionally, so the mesh stretches with the geometry; after a large
  change of a geometry parameter, **Switch to automatic mesh** (Simulation settings) is safer.
  Other numbers stay plain numbers. A parameter that does not appear in any expression (it only
  shapes the mesh, like `mesh_div`, or the model's structure, like a fractal's `iterations`) is not
  added to the copy; the description lists it with the value it was built at. A carried parameter
  can be marked *partly followed*: the example also derives other dimensions from it by a rule that
  is not a linear formula (a microstrip width from `eps_r`, a stub length from `f0`), and that
  geometry stays at its default size when you change the parameter. The results of the example
  are not part of the copy; run the copy for your own.

### Starters

Every starter has a design frequency `f0`, PML boundaries (8 cells, except the patch: MUR), the
automatic mesh at 20 cells per wavelength, end criterion −60 dB, the far field at f0 for the
antennas, and every loss tangent given at f0 (openEMS applies tan δ as a constant conductivity, so
it is exact at one frequency only). Each one simulates in seconds and has no check errors or
warnings. The numbers below are from one run of each at its defaults (GPU engine):

| Starter | What it is | Result at the defaults |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Half-wave dipole | A 1 mm PEC strip in free space, center-fed by a 50 Ω port across a 1 mm gap; the length is `k` wavelengths at f0 (0.466, 58.2 mm at 2.4 GHz) | S11 −15.0 dB at 2.389 GHz, Dmax 2.17 dBi |
| Quarter-wave monopole | A 1 mm strip `k` = 0.233 wavelengths tall on a finite square ground plane (0.8 λ), probe-fed at its base by a 50 Ω port; 2.4 GHz | S11 −17.7 dB at 2.393 GHz, Dmax 3.12 dBi (the small ground tilts the beam up) |
| Open-ended waveguide | A WR-90 guide (22.86 × 10.16 mm, 50 mm long) radiating from its open end, fed by a TE10 waveguide port a quarter guide wavelength in front of a back short; 10 GHz, band 8-12 GHz | S11 −9.9 dB at 10 GHz, −11.5 dB at 12 GHz, Dmax 6.60 dBi |
| Patch antenna starter | A probe-fed patch on RO4003C-like substrate (tan δ 0.0027) over a 60 mm ground plane, 2.45 GHz | −41 dB S11 and about 88 % radiation efficiency at 2.45 GHz (the patch example's 96.5 % comes from its lower tan δ, 0.001) |
| Printed sleeve dipole | [examples/designs/sleeve_dipole_867.design.json](../examples/designs/sleeve_dipole_867.design.json), parametrized as in that file: a coax-fed sleeve dipole on a slim FR-4 strip, no ground plane, for a UAV; 30 cells per wavelength as tuned, efficiency over the band | S11 −19.6 dB at 0.877 GHz (1.1 % high, for a radome), Dmax 2.10 dBi, radiation efficiency 0.977-0.990 over the band |
| Microstrip line (two-port) | A 3.1 mm, 40 mm line on 1.6 mm FR-4 (εr 4.3, tan δ 0.02) with a 50 Ω port at each end; the parameters show the Hammerstad Z0 (50.4 Ω) and ε_eff. Both ports are excited, one run each, for the full S-matrix; no far field | S11 −29.7 dB and S21 −0.3 dB at 2.4 GHz |

A pyramidal horn is not among them: its flared walls are plates in planes that are not normal to
an axis, which the design format cannot hold (polygons lie in axis planes, and a zero-thickness
sheet rotated off the grid axes is refused; a rotated solid at any angle is fine). The open-ended waveguide uses the same TE10 port; for a horn, use the Python model
`python/models/pyramidal_horn.py`. The waveguide's Prad/Pacc reads 1.11 (the horn's 1.04 is the
open point in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md#13-pyramidal-horn-with-a-waveguide-port)), so read its
directivity rather than its gain.

## The workspace

![The designer on the Modeling tab: ribbon, navigation tree, 3D view, properties, dock and status bar](../landing/media/designer-modeling.jpg)

- **Ribbon**: one row of seven tabs, **Home**, **Modeling**, **Transform**, **View**, **Simulation**,
  **Optimize** and **Post-processing**. The groups of a tab:
  - Home:
    - Project: Start, Import macro, Import PCB, Save, Close, Shortcuts.
    - Edit: History (the modeling history), Undo, Redo, Duplicate, Delete.
  - Modeling:
    - Tools: Boolean (Add, Subtract, Intersect, Insert), Pick points, Measure, Align, Align faces,
      Extrude face, Edit points.
    - Shapes: Brick, Cylinder, Sphere, Polygon, Extrude, Cone, Torus, Wire.
    - Draw on the work plane: Brick, Circle, Polygon.
    - WCS: Align with face, Transform WCS…, Align with global, Show WCS.
    - Materials: Library, Add dielectric, Add metal.
    - Parameters: Parameter.
  - Transform: Transform… opens the transform dialog for the selected solid or shape. Rotate,
    Scale, Mirror and Translate copies open it with that operation selected. See [Transforms](#transforms).
  - View: camera presets, Fit and Screenshot, followed by geometry/overlay visibility controls.
    Guide grid controls both the reference grid and active drawing-plane grid; it does not disable
    snapping. Ground plane controls only the model's PEC half-space geometry. Mesh view uses the
    same toggle as Simulation › Mesh. View preserves an
    active 3D result so its camera and overlays can be adjusted.
  - Simulation:
    - Frequency band, and while there is room the f min and f max fields.
    - Boundaries.
    - Mesh: the Cells / λ field (while there is room), Mesh settings, Mesh
      convergence…, Mesh view.
    - Ports: Lumped, Waveguide, Add lumped element….
    - Monitors: Far field, Surface current, Efficiency, Field plane.
    - Solver: Solver limits.
    - Run.
  - Optimize: Parameter sweep, Optimizer.
  - Post-processing: the result tabs to open (Summary, S-parameters, Smith, Efficiency, Pattern, 3D pattern,
    Currents, Field plane, Field map), Farfield (the pattern quantity, only while a pattern is shown), and
    Report and export (PDF report, Package, Python).

  The ribbon remembers the last tab, except that a design with no parts opens on Modeling. Showing a result switches to Post-processing, and going back
  to geometry work returns to the tab you left. A double-click on a tab, the chevron at the right
  or Ctrl+F1 (⌃F1 on macOS) minimizes the ribbon. When the window is narrow, the buttons lose their
  labels (the tooltip keeps the name) and then whole groups fold into drop-down buttons, so every
  command stays reachable.
- **Navigation tree** (left): the design and its **Parameters** row (it opens the Parameters tab
  of the dock), then **Components**, **Materials**, **Ports**,
  **Lumped elements** and **Results**. A red or amber mark shows that a check points at that item.
  The simulation settings are not in the tree: they are the Simulation tab of the ribbon. See
  [The navigation tree](#the-navigation-tree).
- **Main area**: the **3D view** is the first tab and never closes; the result views of a run
  (S-parameters, Impedance, VSWR, Smith, Efficiency, Pattern, Table) open as further tabs beside
  it. Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab switch tabs; Delete or a middle-click closes a result tab.
- **3D view**: the geometry as the run server builds it from your unsaved changes, so what you see
  is what openEMS will mesh. The browser draws each edit at once; the server's version replaces it a
  moment later. Click a part to select it. View sets the camera (Iso, Top, Front, Right,
  Bottom, Back, Left) without changing zoom or the viewing center. Fit frames the model while
  preserving its current orientation. Number keys: **1** snaps to the nearest axis,
  **2** Bottom, **3** Back, **4** Left, **5** Front, **6** Right, **8** Top, **0** Iso.
  Use the numpad (also with Num Lock off) or the number row. Camera shortcuts work while 3D is
  visible, except inside fields, editors, menus, dialogs, or an active drawing tool. With the 3D
  view focused, arrows orbit (Shift pans), +/− zoom, and Space or F fits the model. Orbiting away
  from a preset clears its pressed state. The number-row aliases are provided for laptop keyboards.
- **Properties** (right): the fields of the selected item.
- **Dock** (bottom): **Checks** and **Parameters**, and for a run started here **Run** (its live
  progress), **Runs** (the design's runs side by side, with the parameters that differ) and
  **Log**. Drag its top edge to resize all tabs together, from 120 px to 70% of the center height.
  Focus the edge and use arrow keys (10 px, or 50 px with Shift); Home/End choose the limits.
  The height is remembered in local storage and overrides responsive defaults. Double-click resets it.
  The left and right panel edges also resize in Design and Results (180 px minimum,
  35% of the workspace or 600 px maximum). Arrow keys resize; double-click resets.
  Remembered widths override responsive defaults while panel toggles still hide the panels
  (Ctrl+Shift+1, 2 and 3 fold the tree, the dock and the properties; ⌃⇧1, 2 and 3 on macOS).
- **Status bar**, left to right:
  - the cursor position in the 3D view (on a part, else on the ground plane);
  - the work plane;
  - the units, mm and GHz;
  - the cell count and smallest cell of the preview mesh (a click toggles the mesh view);
  - the check summary (a click shows the Checks tab);
  - a run in progress (a click shows the Run tab);
  - the preview time; while the design has errors, **Preview paused: N errors** (a click shows Checks),
    and **Preview failed** with a Retry button when the server itself could not build it;
  - the run server state (a click looks for the server again; the bar also checks it every ten seconds).

**Close** in the Project group (or **File › Close Design** in the desktop app) releases the open
design and returns to Start. With unsaved changes, choose **Save**, **Don't save**, or **Cancel**.
A failed save leaves the design open and explains the problem. The saved design remains under
**Your designs** so it can be opened again. Close does not cancel a running simulation.

In the desktop app, Ctrl/Cmd+W closes the project (or the window when no project is open). In a browser, use the Close button; Ctrl/Cmd+W remains the browser tab shortcut.

Shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+S saves, Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes, Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z or Ctrl+Y redoes, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter
runs, Delete removes the selection, Escape clears the selection (or stops drawing). Home ›
Shortcuts (or ? in the designer) lists them all.

### The navigation tree

![The navigation tree with a run open under Results, and its 3D pattern in the 3D view](../landing/media/designer-pattern.jpg)

- **Parameters**: one row with the number of parameters; a click opens the Parameters tab of the
  dock.
- **Components**: the parts with their shapes, in component folders when they have one. Drag a part
  onto a folder (or onto the Components heading for the top level) to move it; right-click a part or
  shape for its menu.
- **Materials**, **Ports** and **Lumped elements** (resistors); the + on a heading adds one.
- **Results**: one node per run of the design, newest first, labeled with its name, time and
  engine. The newest is open. Under a run:
  - **1D Results**: S-parameters, impedance, VSWR, Smith chart, efficiency;
  - **Farfields**: for each far-field frequency, the pattern cuts (**Farfield (f = …)**) and the
    **3D pattern (f = …)**;
  - **2D/3D Results**: one surface-current map per monitor frequency, and one node per E/H
    field-plane map, e.g. "E-field (z = 2.572 mm, 2.45 GHz)" (the mesh line the plane was
    recorded on, which may differ slightly from the position typed);
  - **Tables**: the S-parameters and the impedance as numbers;
  - **Log**.

  The runs of a parametric sweep are in one **Sweep …** folder (right-click it for **Compare all
  runs**). The runs of a mesh convergence study are in one **Mesh convergence** folder, with the
  verdict in its detail line ("3 of 4 runs · converged at 30 cells/λ"); its first row,
  **Convergence report**, opens the report ([Mesh convergence](#mesh-convergence)). A finished
  optimization is a node of its own with **Optimization history**, **Open best**, **Save best as a
  run** and **Apply best parameters to design** ([OPTIMIZE.md](OPTIMIZE.md)).

  Selecting a result shows the run in the 3D view (the 3D pattern of a far field, the map of a
  surface current or field plane) or opens its plot as a tab in the main area. Selecting a geometry
  item, editing the design, choosing a ribbon tab other than Post-processing, or leaving the
  designer takes the pattern or map off the 3D view and goes back to the geometry; result tabs of
  the main area stay open. **Ctrl/⌘-click** further runs (or tick them under **Compare** in a
  result tab's toolbar, or click their labels in the dock's **Runs** tab) to compare up to eight,
  one color each: the result tab draws them together (S-parameters, impedance, VSWR, Smith,
  pattern cuts, table). For multi-port runs the S-parameter picker chooses the S_ij (dB or phase),
  drawn for every run in its color with one dash per picked pair, and the Smith chart shows the
  picked port of every run. The dock's **Runs** tab lists the design's runs by their short labels
  (A, B, …, the ones the legends use) with the parameters that differ between them marked and the
  solver time; a run's label there adds it to the comparison or removes it, its name shows it.
  **Copy data** (Ctrl/⌘+C) and **CSV** in the result tab's toolbar write what the plot shows: the
  picked S_ij in dB or phase, the Smith port, every compared run named like the legend; the
  format menu beside them chooses As plotted, dB, dB + phase, Re/Im, Linear magnitude + phase or All.
  The **Figure** menu beside them saves the plot as PNG (300 dpi) or SVG, with the design name,
  view and frequency as a title, always in the light style on white paper whatever the app theme.
  Figures, CSV and Touchstone files of a result share one name:
  `<design>_<view>_<frequency>_<run time>` (for example
  `patch_antenna_impedance_1.5-3GHz_2026-10-07T10-22-01+0300.csv`), with the frequency of a sweep or
  of the selected far-field cut, the run time written without colons, and only letters, digits and
  `_ . + -`, so the name is valid on Windows and macOS. Touchstone files use the view `sparams`.

The **Filter** box at the top keeps the items whose name or detail contains every word typed, with
the folders above them; Escape clears it. The tree works from the keyboard: Up/Down move, Right
opens or steps in, Left closes or goes to the parent, Home/End jump, Enter selects.

## Modeling

### Parameters and expressions

Every length (mm) and frequency (GHz) field takes a number or an expression over the parameters:
`W/2`, `h + 0.035`, `wavelength(f0) / 4`. The field shows the value as you type (`= 16`) and marks an
expression that does not evaluate.

- An **independent** parameter has a default value, a unit, an optional range and a label. Sweeps,
  the optimizer and the Run panel's form change it.
- A **derived** parameter has an expression over the parameters above it (for example
  `lam = wavelength(f0)`).
- Operators: `+ - * / // % **` and parentheses. Constants: `pi`, `c0`, `eps0`, `mu0`. Functions:
  `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `exp`, `log`, `log10`, `abs`,
  `min`, `max`, `round`, `floor`, `ceil`, `radians`, `degrees` and `wavelength(f_GHz)` (free-space
  wavelength in mm). The rules are Python's, and the run server's evaluator stays the authority.
- Numbers are doubles (IEEE-754 binary64) on both sides: a number is read as the nearest double, as
  JSON reads it, and every step of an expression is a double, so the browser and the server give the
  same value (`9007199254740993 - 9007199254740992` is `0`; Python's exact whole numbers are not
  used). A number, name or step that is not finite is an error, even when a later step would bring
  it back (`1e999`, `1 / (1e308 * 10)`). `round(x, n)` accepts `n` written as `2.0`. Functions such as
  `sin` or `log` come from each side's maths library and may differ in the last digit (about 1e-16).
- Expressions use ASCII only: digits, letters, `_`, operators, parentheses, commas and spaces.
  A whole number cannot start with `0` (`07`), and comments (`#`) are not allowed.
- A parameter key is letters, digits and `_` (ASCII), not starting with a digit, and not a
  function, a constant or a Python keyword (`in`, `lambda`, `True`, ...). Other names, such as
  `__proto__`, `constructor` or `match`, are ordinary keys. The Parameters dock marks a refused key
  as you type. A design file that already has one does not load (the server's error names the key,
  as for any invalid design file) until the key is renamed in the file.

Add a parameter with ribbon Modeling › Parameters › Parameter or **Add parameter** in the Parameters dock:
it gets the first free key p1, p2, … and no unit (fill the unit cell for a length or a frequency; a ratio
or εr stays a bare number). Every keystroke in the table applies at once (the 3D view follows), except
in the Key cell: a new key applies on **Enter** or when the cell is left, and renames the parameter
everywhere it is used in one undo step (the shapes, transforms, cuts, ports, lumped elements, materials,
mesh and simulation fields, the other parameters, the operands a Boolean result keeps and the parameter
sweep), so renaming `fw` to `feed_w` leaves nothing that names `fw`. An invalid or taken key shows
its error under the cell and is not applied; Escape returns to the key as it was. A parameter that a
field still uses is not deleted (the trash button, Home › Edit › Delete, the Delete key): the message
names the places that use it, as for a material in use; **Duplicate** copies it as `key_2`.
**Enter** commits the cell and
moves down to the same cell of the next row; **Escape** takes back only what was typed since the
last commit, never a value already committed; leaving a cell (Tab, a click) commits it.
The compact table shows Key, Expression / value, Evaluated value, Unit and Description.
Min and Max are optional: **Ranges** reveals them, as does opening a sweep or optimization in the
Run panel. Existing limits stay in the file, and the run forms accept their own ranges.
Enter a plain number for a default or an expression for a derived parameter (marked `=`).
Descriptions edit in place; **Label** opens the optional display label. Validation remains on
fields and in Checks; focus or hover a cell to read its details. Arrow keys move between focused
rows, Enter edits the key, and Escape restores the cell's value before editing.
Unknown names in expression fields offer **Create parameter** inline after Enter or leaving the
field. The new value can itself be an expression of preceding parameters, such as `lam/4`.

### Materials and parts

A **material** is a metal or a dielectric with εr, a loss tangent tan δ and the frequency where
tan δ holds (the band center if empty). Add one with ribbon Modeling › Materials › Dielectric or Metal.
A new dielectric (also one added from the library) gives tan δ at `f0` when the design has an `f0`
parameter inside its band, else at the band center (the frequency left empty), not at a datasheet's
1 or 10 GHz.

openEMS applies tan δ as a constant conductivity, so the loss is exact at that frequency only and
scales as f_ref / f elsewhere: a datasheet value at 10 GHz used at 2.45 GHz gives four times the
loss. Give the frequency the design works at (e.g. `f0`); a check warns when it lies outside the
band. (A datasheet value taken at 10 GHz and used at 2.45 GHz made the patch starter's radiation
efficiency 65 % instead of 88 %; the starter now uses a value at its own frequency.)

A metal is a perfect conductor (PEC) unless it has a **Conductivity** (S/m; presets Copper 5.8e7,
Aluminum 3.5e7, Gold 4.1e7, PEC = empty) in Properties. A lossy metal's sheets become openEMS
conducting sheets (a surface-impedance model of a thin conductor, `AddConductingSheet`) of the
**Sheet thickness** (mm, 0.035 = 1 oz copper if empty; a thin brick built as a sheet keeps its drawn
thickness); its volumes become a material of that conductivity, which is only accurate where the
mesh resolves the skin depth (about 1.3 µm for copper at 2.45 GHz: never in an antenna mesh, so a
thick lossy volume behaves almost like PEC); wires stay perfect conductors. On the patch starter
(coarse, GPU) copper instead of PEC lowers the radiation efficiency at 2.45 GHz from 88.2 % to
86.5 % and the gain from 6.21 to 6.12 dBi. A macro's "Lossy metal" imports with its
conductivity, and the macro export writes one.

Modeling › Materials › **Library** lists common antenna materials with nominal values and their source: PEC
(copper), FR4, Rogers RO4003C, RO4350B and RT/duroid 5880, Taconic TLY-5, alumina, PTFE and air.
**Add** copies the values into the design as a new material, so the design file stays
self-contained; edit the copy in Properties.

**My materials.** The library dialog has two groups, **Built-in** and **My materials**. Save a material of
the design to My materials with right-click in the tree › **Save to my materials**, or the button at the
bottom of its Properties: a dielectric keeps εr, tan δ and the frequency, a metal its conductivity and sheet
thickness, and both the color. Saving again under the same name updates that entry. Values that are
parameter expressions cannot be saved (the library holds plain numbers). **Add** on a My materials row
copies its values into the design like a built-in entry does, so a design file always carries a full copy of
every material it uses and its format does not change. The dielectrics of My materials are also offered as
the substrate of the PCB import. **My materials…** in the library dialog opens the list to rename, edit
(εr, tan δ, conductivity, thickness) and delete entries, **Export** it to a JSON file
(`{"version": 1, "materials": [...]}`) and **Import** a file from a colleague: bad entries are skipped with a
warning, and a name already in use gets a number. The list is kept in `materials.json` in the workspace
when the run server is connected (see [RUN-SERVER.md](RUN-SERVER.md#my-materials)), else in this browser's
localStorage.

A **part** is one material and one or more shapes: in openEMS it is one CSXCAD property. Where parts
overlap, the higher priority wins (metal 10, dielectric 0 by default; a shape can set its own).
Select a part to rename it, change its material, put it in a component folder, add shapes, cuts or
transforms.

**Components.** A part's Component field is a folder path such as `antenna/feed`; the tree groups
the parts in folders by it. The build ignores it (the exported Python names
it in a comment). A design without components loads unchanged: every part is at the top level.
To make a component, choose **Move to component ›** on a part and type a new name (a `/` makes a
subfolder), or drag a part onto another part at the top level. Right-click a component folder for
**Rename component** (or F2 on the folder row; parts in its subfolders follow), **Ungroup
component** (its parts and subfolders move up one level) and **Delete component and its parts**;
**Show parts** and **Hide parts** act on everything inside. Each is one undo step.

Right-click a solid or shape in the tree or the 3D view for Rename, Hide, Transform…, Color…,
Round corners… (on a box), Boolean ›, Move to component ›, Add discrete port here (when the picked
metal face supports it), Duplicate and Delete. Rename edits the
displayed label inline in the tree; a shape's label is saved in the design without changing its
geometry. Move to component lists the existing folders in place (and a field for a new one). In the
3D view, **Add discrete port here** starts at the picked point and uses the face's dominant axis,
offering the metals behind and in front of it (a patch's ground plane) as the other end. Review
the endpoints before adding. Shift+F10 or the Menu key
opens the menu for a focused tree item or the selected viewport part. Up/Down, Home/End navigate;
Escape closes and returns focus. Blank viewport space keeps the browser menu.

**Seeing what you add.** A new shape, a drawn or extruded one, a duplicate, and a new port or
resistor are selected and the 3D view fits them once, keeping your viewing direction: a port or
resistor is framed with the smallest metal it touches, so you see where the feed sits. Selecting
or editing afterwards never moves the camera; Fit (F or 0 in the 3D view) shows the whole model.

### Shapes

The Modeling tab's Shapes group adds a shape:

- Brick, Cylinder, Sphere, Polygon and Extrude open a shape dialog with a shape of a sensible size
  on the work plane. Every value takes an expression, and the 3D view outlines the shape as you
  edit. Choose a new part (with its name and material) or an existing part to add it to. OK adds it
  in one undo step; Cancel adds nothing. The material starts as the dielectric while the design has
  no solid yet (the substrate is the first brick of a printed antenna), then as the material you
  used last for a new solid in this design, else the first metal.
- Cone, Torus and Wire add a new part with one shape in the design's metal; edit it in Properties.

Adding or duplicating a part or shape selects it and fits the 3D view to its bounds once, keeping
the current viewing direction. You can immediately orbit, pan or zoom; subsequent edits and server
previews leave the camera where you put it.

A part's properties also add more shapes to it. The kinds:

- **Brick**: Xmin/Xmax, Ymin/Ymax, Zmin/Zmax. Zero thickness on one axis makes a sheet (a patch, a
  ground plane, a trace).
- **Cylinder**: axis, center, radius, inner radius (above 0: a tube) and the range along the axis.
  With min = max the range has no length: a **flat circle** (a ring when there is an inner radius),
  a sheet. The build makes it a regular polygon with vertices on the circle, an even number of
  sides that keeps every edge within 0.01 mm of the arc and is never below 64 (a ring is two half
  rings, since CSXCAD polygons have no holes). The VBA macro exports a full circle as a Circle
  with a cover, a ring as polygons.
- **Sphere**: center and radius.
- **Polygon**: a flat sheet with corners in a plane (normal and elevation).
- **Extrude**: a polygon extruded by a length along its normal. In the shape dialog, a polygon with
  a height other than 0 becomes an extrusion.
- **Cone**: axis, center, the bottom and top radius (0: a sharp tip) and the range along the axis.
- **Torus**: axis, center, the major radius (axis to the tube center) and the minor radius (the
  tube). openEMS gets the tube as a 64-sided polygon turned about the axis.
- **Wire**: a thin wire along a polyline of points, with a radius. The automatic mesh puts fine
  cells around it.
- **Polyhedron** (`{"kind": "polyhedron", "vertices": [[x, y, z], ...], "faces": [[i, j, k, ...], ...]}`):
  a closed solid from its vertices (expressions allowed, at least 4) and polygon faces (lists of
  vertex indices, at least 4 faces of at least 3 different, existing indices each). There is no
  drawing tool; it comes from an example (the pyramidal horn) or a JSON file, and Properties shows
  its vertex and face counts and the vertices read-only. The build (CSXCAD `AddPolyhedron`) and the
  3D view fan every face into triangles, oriented outward by the enclosed volume, so a mirrored copy
  still builds. Part transforms (move, rotate, scale, mirror, copies) map the vertices. The VBA macro format has no
  polyhedron, so the macro skips it and lists a warning; the Python export writes
  `add_polyhedron(...)` with a small helper. The checks use its bounding box, and refuse bad
  indices (`polyhedron`) or vertices all in one plane (`polyhedron-flat`).

### Drawing on the work plane

The Modeling tab's Draw on the work plane group draws with the mouse on the work plane in the 3D view:

- **Brick**: click two opposite corners.
- **Circle**: click the center, then a point on the rim (a cylinder, or a flat circle sheet when the
  height is 0).
- **Polygon**: click the corners; click the first point again, double-click or press Enter to close
  it.

A hint under the ribbon says what to click next and how many points are placed. Escape or Backspace
removes the last point (the first one too, staying in the tool); Escape with no point placed stops
drawing, and a tool armed again starts with no points. Enter before the first click opens the tool's
shape dialog with default values. A finished shape opens the
shape dialog, prefilled with what you drew, unless "Confirm drawn shapes in a dialog" is off in the
group's Options panel; then it goes straight into a new part. Finishing a shape also leaves the
drawing mode: OK in the dialog ends with the new shape selected and no tool left to
cancel. A double-click or Enter finishes the shape, Escape cancels it.

**Typed coordinates.** While drawing, start typing (a digit, `-`, `@`, `=` or a letter) to enter a
point instead of clicking; Enter places it:

- `u, v`: a point on the work plane; values can be expressions (`W/2, L/2`) and stay expressions in
  the shape.
- `@du, dv`: relative to the last point.
- Brick, second corner: `w, h` is the size; `=u, v` gives the corner itself.
- Circle, rim: one value is the radius.

**Snapping.** Points snap to the grid of the work plane and, when the pointer is close to one, to
the corners, edge midpoints and edges of existing geometry on the plane (a dot marks the snap).
The group's Options panel turns each kind on or off.

### Work coordinate system (WCS)

The WCS is where drawing happens: the global WCS (u, v, w are x, y, z) is the starting
point, and four buttons in Modeling › WCS change it:

- **Align with face**: click a face of a part in the 3D view. The WCS origin goes to the face
  centre and w along the face's outward normal (u along +x, or +y on a face looking along x). Only
  faces along x, y or z can be picked. The origin keeps the face's own expression: a WCS on
  "Substrate: top" sits at z = h and follows the substrate when h changes.
- **Transform WCS…**: one dialog. **Move along** u, v, w shifts the origin along the current WCS
  axes; **Rotate about** u, v, w turns the WCS (applied in that order, each about the axes the
  previous turn left), in multiples of 90° because the geometry stays axis aligned. Values take
  expressions (a rotation is evaluated to a number). The dialog shows the resulting origin and axes.
  With a point picked by Pick points, "Move the origin to the picked point" is offered too.
- **Align with global** puts everything back. Shapes
  already drawn stay where they are; points placed for an unfinished shape are dropped.
- **Show WCS** shows or hides the u, v, w arrows of a local WCS in the 3D view.

While a local WCS is active the corner axes gizmo, the 3D cursor readout, the status bar, the drawing
readout, the typed-coordinate prompt and the shape dialogs say u, v, w instead of x, y, z, the
work-plane grid is labelled u and v, and the status bar shows a **Local WCS** badge; clicking it (or
**Align with global**) returns to the global WCS. With the global WCS everything is x, y, z.

Grid snap, the default height (the extrusion of a drawn brick or circle; 0 draws a sheet), what the
pointer snaps to (corners, midpoints, edges), whether drawn shapes are confirmed in the shape dialog
and "Look at the plane" are in the **Options** panel of the Draw group.

Shapes drawn or created from the Shapes palette in a local WCS are described in its coordinates:
the dialogs show them, and the new part carries ordinary ordered rotate/move transforms that place
it in global coordinates (parameter expressions stay expressions). Existing parts stay unchanged, and
returning to global affects future drawing only. A face looking along -x, -y or -z gives a WCS whose
w points the other way: the part then also carries a half-turn about an in-plane axis.

**Saved with the design.** A WCS other than the global one is stored in the design file as an
optional top-level `wcs` field (`normal`, `origin` as three expressions, `angle` in 90° steps, and
`flip` when w points along the negative axis), so it survives save and reopen. Designs without the
field open with the global WCS, the server ignores the field, and geometry never depends on it.
Every WCS change is one undo step. Unresolved or nonfinite origins are reported and cannot be
committed by the shape dialog or mouse drawing; correct them or their parameters first.

### Transforms

Select a solid (or one of its shapes) and choose the Transform tab's **Transform…** button, the
context menu's **Transform…** or Ctrl/Cmd+T (desktop app). One panel beside the 3D viewport holds the operations,
chosen as **Operation**:

- **Translate** shifts the selection by an x, y, z step. With **Copy** off it moves the existing
  geometry (each value accepts expressions); it is an ordered, editable transform, so a move after
  an array moves the entire array in world coordinates, and a move before a mirror changes where the
  mirrored result lands. With **Copy** on, the **Repetition factor (copies to add)** gives that many
  more copies, the k-th shifted by k × step (the original stays). Values can be expressions, so
  `copies = N - 1` and `step = [d, 0, 0]` make an array that follows the parameters. **Use last two
  picked points** takes the step from two points picked with Pick points, and **Pick anchor and
  place in viewport** moves the part by clicking an anchor on it and a target.
- **Scale** by x, y, z factors about an origin. Only positive, uniform factors are accepted.
- **Rotate** about x, y or z through a chosen center, by an angle in degrees. Positive angles
  follow the right-hand rule. Angles and center coordinates accept expressions. With Copy off (or
  zero copies) the original rotates; with a positive count the original stays and copies appear at
  angle, 2 × angle, and so on. Arbitrary angles are supported. Quarter turns retain the existing
  axis-remapping path; other angles attach a transformation matrix to the native primitive in
  CSXCAD. The solver uses the rotated shape, not its surrounding bounding box. Automatic meshing
  uses its world-coordinate bounds. Boolean operations on arbitrarily oriented operands remain
  unsupported and produce a validation error.
- **Mirror** across the plane through a **Point on plane** whose **Plane normal axis** is x, y or
  z; **Keep original (add mirrored copy)** decides whether the original stays.

**Duplicate** (Home › Edit, or Ctrl/Cmd+D) copies the selected solid, shape, port, lumped element,
parameter or material; **Delete** removes the selection (a material or a parameter only while nothing
uses it). A duplicated solid lies on its original on purpose, so it raises no overlap prompt; moving or
editing it into another solid does.

**Selection in the 3D view.** The selected solid gets a red tint, an outline and an x-ray fill drawn
over everything. When one shape of a solid is selected in the tree, only that shape gets the full
highlight and the solid's other shapes a faint outline. Solids that enclose the selection (its
centre lies inside them, such as a substrate around a via) are drawn faint while it is selected;
solids that only touch it keep their look.

Transforms stay editable (and removable) in the part's properties; they are expanded exactly when
the model is built. Transforming one shape in a multi-shape part makes that shape an independent
part, retaining its material, cuts and earlier transforms, so its siblings stay in place. Ports and
lumped resistors do not move with the shapes: they stay at their world coordinates, and the panel
says so. When a transform leaves no original in place (a move, a rotation, scale or mirror without
the original kept) and ports sit on the selected metal, the panel warns prominently, names those
ports and offers **Select port N** for each: a port that no longer spans the gap between two
conductors gives |S11| of about 0 dB and no radiation (the checks flag it as `port-floating`, and the
run quality verdict as an uncoupled port).
The panel previews the result as an outline in the 3D view while you type. The viewport remains
interactive: orbit, zoom and change the camera without closing the controls. **View rotation plane**
looks along the selected axis to make planar rotations easier to inspect. On narrow layouts the controls sit below the view.
**Preview** refreshes that temporary outline; **Apply** commits it once, as one undo step, and closes the panel.
Cancel removes the outline without changing the design. Apply is available only when the preview
matches the current valid inputs. Switching operations resets the Copy choice to its default.
Editing the underlying design elsewhere closes the panel so an older preview cannot overwrite
the newer edit. A tilted polygon's local vertex coordinates remain editable in Properties, but
dragging those vertices on a world-aligned drawing plane is disabled.

Design and Python exports preserve arbitrary rotations, and the VBA macro exports them as `Transform`
steps after the shape (mirror, scale, rotate about x, y and z, translate; a shear as a matrix, with a
warning). Fabrication export supports boards rotated within
the XY plane; a tilted substrate is not flattened into an incorrect fabrication outline.
Zero-thickness metal sheets must remain parallel to a solver coordinate plane; lossy sheets must
also preserve their local normal axis under affine transforms. Rotating within their plane is
supported. To tilt metal out of that plane, model its finite thickness and resolve it with a suitable
mesh. These checks prevent a visible preview from implying unsupported thin-sheet solver behavior.

Right-click a component folder and choose **Transform component** to transform all its solids,
including nested folders, around one shared origin/center/plane. The preview includes every
member, and one Undo restores them all. Folder moves only change organization: drag the part row
(or a single-shape part's shape row) onto a component folder. **Move to component** in the context
menu provides the keyboard equivalent. Part material and geometry remain unchanged.

### Booleans, picking and aligning

The **Tools** group (Modeling tab) holds the commands that work on several solids or
on picked geometry:

- **Boolean** combines two parts, A (kept) and B: **Add** (union), **Subtract** (A − B), **Intersect**
  and **Insert** (A − B with B kept). Select A, choose the operation (or press + − * / with A then
  B selected: the 3D view previews A op B, Enter or the same key again applies it). With A selected, the Tools › Boolean menu and the right-click › Boolean submenu list the other
  solids: **Subtract ›** (or **Add ›**, **Intersect ›**, **Insert ›**) and one pick applies the
  Boolean at once, in one undo step. Without a selection, choose the operation, then pick B.
  The 3D view previews the result with the operands in color; **Apply** (Enter) keeps it,
  **Swap A ↔ B** exchanges the operands, Escape cancels. The result is live: it keeps its operands
  and is recomputed when parameters change, in the browser and in the build. It is exact for
  bricks, sheets and polygons whose planes share one normal (the exact clipping of bricks and
  polygons), and works for every other shape too, as listed below. Polygons along different axes,
  and the combinations marked refused, are refused with the reason. The Boolean menu's **History**
  lists the results.

  | Operation | Bricks, sheets, polygons | Cylinders, tubes, cones, spheres, tori, wires, polyhedra (alone or mixed with those) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Add** | exact union | exact: the shapes are kept together (A and B share material and priority, so overlap is a union); bricks and polygons are united |
  | **Insert** | exact A − B | exact: A stays whole, B (a part of its own) is lifted half a priority step above it |
  | **Subtract** | exact A − B | exact: B becomes a cut-out of A (a vacuum shape above it, see Cut-outs below). A cylinder minus a coaxial cylinder or tube is exactly a tube (a counterbore: tubes and cylinders) |
  | **Intersect** | exact | exact for coaxial cylinders and tubes, a tube or cone trimmed by a brick across its axis, a shape lying completely inside a brick, and cylinders with bricks or polygons along the cylinder's axis (the cylinder is clipped as a 64-gon prism; the native cylinder stays when the clip leaves its ring untouched, otherwise the clipped part is a 64-gon prism, within 0.12 % of the radius). Everything else (sphere ∩ cylinder, crossing cylinders, polyhedra, a sphere cut by a brick) is refused with the combination and what to do instead: Subtract the part you do not want (for example a brick on each side to cut away), or draw the common shape as an extruded polygon or a polyhedron |

  Operands that already carry a cut-out (the result of a Subtract) can be subtracted from again
  (the cut-outs add up) or inserted, but not added to, intersected or subtracted: restore the
  operands from the History first. An overlap with curved shapes opens the same overlap prompt as
  for bricks (the shapes themselves are tested, not their bounding boxes). Arbitrary-angle
  rotations of the operands are refused for every shape, as before.
- **Pick points** picks a **Vertex**, a **Mesh midpoint** or a **Face / circle center** in the 3D
  view; **Measure** shows the distance between two picked points and the included angle of the last
  three. A picked point can also fill a coordinate in the transform dialog and move the WCS origin.
- **Align** picks a point on the part to move and then a target point. **Align faces** picks a
  flat face of the part and a target face: the part turns by quarter turns when needed and moves
  so the faces meet (**Against**, face to face) or lie in one plane (**Flush**), optionally centered
  on the target face. Only faces along x, y or z work (box and sheet faces, polygon and extrusion
  faces, the flat caps of cylinders and cones). The result is an ordinary transform.
- **Extrude face** (key S) picks a flat face and asks for a **Thickness**, **Material**, **Name**
  and **Component path**; it adds a new part thickened from that face. The 3D view outlines the new
  solid (dashed, temporary) while you type the thickness.
- **Edit points** lets you edit the corners of the selected polygon or wire in the 3D view: drag a
  point to move it, + inserts one, Delete removes one. Each change is one undo step.

### Cut-outs (void carvers)

- Contract: any primitive may carry `"void": true`; it lives in its part's `primitives` list, the part's transforms apply to it, the part's sheet `cuts` do not. Older readers ignore the marker.
- Build: a void becomes vacuum (eps_r 1, mu_r 1, lossless; a property named "<part> (cut)") with the priority given explicitly, or else the highest priority of the part's own solid shapes + 0.5 (default 10 for metal, 0 for dielectric), so it erases every lower-priority material inside it. Fractional priorities are ranked to integers (order and ties kept; ports and resistors keep their place at 5) only when a design has one.
- Warning: the check `boolean-cut-erases` warns when another part with the same or a lower priority lies inside a cut-out (it is erased too); `boolean-cut-reach` warns when a cut-out leaves a gap to a zero-thickness sheet of its own part, or has no thickness, and so removes nothing.
- A Subtract with a curved shape (or one cut across a sheet) is stored this way: the result's `primitives` are A's shapes followed by B's as `void` shapes, with the history (operation, A, B) beside them. A cut-out only removes a zero-thickness sheet (a ground plane) it reaches: measured with openEMS 0.37 (PEC edge counts), a volume crossing the sheet and one whose face lies exactly on it cut it alike, one with a gap and a flat (zero-thickness) one cut nothing. A face within rounding of the sheet is therefore made to lie exactly on it, and a flat B is refused. The cut-out also erases everything of equal or lower priority inside it (a pin through a hole in the ground needs a priority above the ground, such as 11, and the substrate inside the hole is erased unless it has a higher priority): the check says so.
- 3D view and exports: the cut-out is drawn as a dashed translucent ghost in the Subtract colour on top of the solid ("A with a hole"), in the Boolean preview too. The VBA macro export emits a real `Solid.Subtract` of a vacuum tool solid from each host shape (and `Solid.Insert` for an Insert by priority, from the designer); STL, GLB, Blender, fabrication and drawing exports skip cut-outs. The bundle marks the vacuum part `void: true` (docs/BUNDLE.md); other readers see an ordinary eps_r 1 part.

### Cuts (boolean subtraction)

A part's properties have **Add a cut**, **Add a round hole** and **Add a polygon cut**: a shape
removed from the part's flat sheets in the same plane, for slots, U-slots, E-shapes, inset notches
and clearance holes. A rectangle cut is given like a sheet brick (min = max on the sheet's axis); a
round hole by its plane (normal and position), center and radius, built as a regular polygon like a
flat circle; a polygon cut by its plane and points. Values take expressions. Cuts apply before the
part's transforms, to every flat sheet in their plane: rectangular sheets, polygons and flat
circles. CSXCAD polygons cannot have holes, so the build replaces each cut sheet by the exact
difference: boxes when only rectangles cut a rectangular sheet, otherwise polygons clipped in 2D
(a hole leaves its surround as several polygons that meet along their edges).

What stays refused, with a check that says why: a cut does not remove volume. When the cut plane
crosses a solid of the same part (a brick with thickness, an extrusion, a real cylinder, a sphere,
...), that shape is left whole and the cut-unsupported check says so; make the shape a sheet or
carve it with a Boolean subtract. A live Boolean of bricks cannot take a round or polygon cut on an
operand (the sheets would become polygons); use a rectangle cut or apply the cut before the Boolean.

### Ports and resistors

Ribbon Simulation › Ports › **Lumped** or **Waveguide** adds a port; its properties switch it
between **Lumped** and **Waveguide**.

- **Lumped port**: a number, an impedance, a start and stop point and the current direction
  (x, y or z). A probe feed runs from the ground plane to the patch: start and stop differ only
  along the direction.
- **Waveguide port**: a rectangular waveguide port (openEMS RectWGPort) with a TE mode (TE10 by
  default), the width a and height b of the guide across the propagation direction, and start and
  stop spanning the guide cross-section: the excitation in the start plane, the probes in the stop
  plane. The properties show the cut-off frequency of the mode, and "Fit the port box to a × b"
  sets stop from start. openEMS excites TE modes only. Run the guide into a PML boundary behind the
  port so the backward wave is absorbed.
- "Excited (driven) port" chooses whether a port is driven; with several driven ports, Fairbeam runs
  once per port and stores the S-matrix ([MULTIPORT.md](MULTIPORT.md)).
- **Resistor** (Simulation › Ports › Resistor): a lumped resistor between two points, for terminations and loads.

**Grouped discrete ports (opt-in).** In a lumped port's properties, **Add grouped feed** adds a
physical feed while keeping one logical port number, excitation selection and reference
impedance. Move the added feed before running; it initially copies the first feed and the overlap
check blocks that duplicate gap. Choose Parallel or Series and the additional feed's polarity
(+1 or −1); the first feed always has positive polarity. All coordinates support expressions.
Removing the last additional feed returns to an ordinary port. Remove additional feeds before
switching to a waveguide port.

For N feeds and logical resistance R, Parallel uses N·R per physical termination, averages signed
voltages and sums signed currents. Series uses R/N per termination, sums signed voltages and
averages signed currents. These operations select a mode; they do not add wires or join solids.
For a differential pair with the same geometric orientation, choose Series and −1 on the second
feed. Oppositely oriented ground-to-strip feeds may instead use Parallel with +1 on both.
Source strengths account for each gap length, so member voltage strengths follow these signs.

Save/reopen, Python Apply/export, previews, mesh checks, drawings and fabrication feed locations
retain all members. The official Python entry point is
`sim.lumped_port(..., group={"connection": "parallel", "members": [...]})`; an optional integer
`group.priority` defaults to 5. Each member contains `start`, `stop`, `direction` and optional
`polarity`. There may be 1–15 additional feeds. Custom measurement adapters remain unsupported
by Python-to-Designer conversion. The Export dialog refuses a VBA macro with grouped electrical
ports; the package export writes a geometry-only macro instead (no ports or lumped elements, noted
in its header).

The reported impedance, S-parameters and accepted power belong to the selected mode. Orthogonal
member modes are excluded, so modal power need not equal the sum of physical member powers in
an unbalanced field. These format and normalization tests establish no mesh-converged result
for Examples 7.7 or 7.8.

Designs use the automatic mesh; a hand-made mesh needs a Python model ([MODELS.md](MODELS.md)).

## Checks

The Checks list in the dock watches the design as you edit. Instant checks run in the browser:
expressions and parameter ranges, inverted or flat bricks, radii and lengths of the other shapes,
polygons, empty parts and duplicate names, cuts, the ports (length, overlap, impedance, the
waveguide mode, size and cut-off), resistors, the materials and the band. The server adds its own
with every preview: the design must build, the far-field and monitor frequencies must lie in the
band, and the mesh is checked. **Errors** stop a run, **warnings** do not, and **notes** (ⓘ) only
say what the build does that the drawing does not show.

The server's checks include the causes of runs that cannot converge or hardly radiate:
- `excitation-too-long`: the excitation pulse (about 2 ns at f max = 3 GHz) takes more than half of
  the timestep limit, because a tiny cell makes the timestep tiny (a warning). At or above the limit
  the run cannot converge at all: that is an error, and the run is refused until the mesh or the
  limit changes.
- `thin-metal` (note): a metal brick far thinner than the mesh can resolve, such as 35 µm PCB
  copper, is built as a sheet (see Mesh under Simulation settings).
- `port-in-metal`: a lumped port that reaches into a metal volume, which shorts it. A port spans
  the gap between two conductors, from the face of one to the face of the other. Metal across the
  port's middle is an error (the run is refused); an end that only reaches into metal is a warning.
- `port-at-null`: a probe at the center of the plate it feeds. For a patch that is the voltage null
  of the TM10 and TM01 modes: the feed sees almost 0 Ω. Move it about 0.15 × the resonant length
  off the center.
- `metal-overhang`: a metal plate or sheet lying on a dielectric face (or inside a dielectric
  layer) that reaches past the dielectric's edge into the air, for example a patch wider than its
  substrate. The message says by how much and on which side ("by 1.2 mm (x+)"). Metal that runs
  onto another metal body past the edge (a connector) is not flagged, and neither is metal that
  lies on no dielectric at all, such as a horn or a wire antenna in the air.
- `metal-floating`: metal that touches no other metal, no dielectric, no port, no resistor and no
  PEC boundary, and that is plainly misplaced: it hovers just off the structure (within 5 % of its
  own size of a dielectric or of connected metal, such as a patch left above a substrate that got
  thinner), it lies in the plane of a dielectric face but off its edge, or it is a solid block in
  the air. Plates and strips further away (a director, a reflector, a stacked patch on an air gap)
  are taken as parasitic elements and not flagged.

- `air-pad`: an explicit air padding (Simulation settings › Mesh) under half of what the automatic
  one gives, a quarter wavelength at f min (an eighth without the far field), so that the open
  boundaries and the far-field box sit close to the structure. Zero (the structure runs into the
  boundary) and designs whose sides are all PEC or PMC are left alone.

**One-click fixes.** Where the fix is unambiguous, the check carries a button that edits the design
in one undo step; it re-checks when it is applied, so the check goes away:

| Check | Button |
|---|---|
| `tan-d-band` | **Give tan δ at f0** (the band center when the design has no f0 inside the band) |
| `port-in-metal` (an end reaching into metal) | **Move the end onto the face of 'gnd'**: the metal's own face on the port's side |
| `port-floating` | **Move the end onto the nearest metal face**: a face of metal along the port's axis within half the port's length |
| `no-port` (no port at all), `port-floating` | **Add a discrete port…** opens the discrete-port dialog (the check's own button, beside the fix when there is one) |
| `no-port` | **Add a probe port between 'gnd' and 'patch'**, only for exactly one patch over one ground plane and no other metal: from the ground's face to the patch's, 0.15 × the patch's shorter side off its center |
| `metal-overhang` | **Trim the metal to 'substrate'**: clips a brick drawn as it is (no array, cuts or live Boolean) to what it lies on, unless that would cut it off a port |
| `air-pad` | **Set the air padding to λ/4** (λ/8 without the far field) |
| `port-at-null`, `excitation-too-long` | move the feed off the center, raise max timesteps |

The fixes use the design's own expressions where they give the right value (a port end moved to
`h`, a patch trimmed to `G/2`), so the edited design stays parametric. Without an offer the check
is ambiguous: an array, several patches, a port in the middle of a metal body.

Both look at the resolved, transformed geometry through bounding boxes, which are exact for
bricks, sheets and their quarter-turn rotated copies. Only bricks and polygons are judged; round
and bent shapes only count as something that metal touches, so an approximate box can hide a
problem but not invent one. They are skipped while the design has errors. Like the other
geometry checks, clicking one selects and frames the part in 3D.

A run that stopped at the timestep limit says why in Results: either the excitation pulse took
most of the limit (with the timestep and the smallest cell), or the fields decayed slowly.

Click a check (or press Enter or Space on it) to expand its explanation. Geometry checks also
select and frame the item in 3D; focus stays on the check. Use **Show in 3D** to frame it again,
or **Edit field** to focus the input. Non-geometry checks also require **Edit field** to jump to
their field. The explanation stays open while its value changes and closes when the check is
resolved. The dock's Checks tab shows the count, and so does the status bar.

Saving is always allowed: a work in progress with errors is fine on disk, and the save message
counts the errors. The run server refuses to run a design with check errors (HTTP 422 with the
list), whether the run comes from the designer, the Run panel, a sweep or the optimizer.

## Simulation settings

The Simulation tab's buttons (Frequency band, Boundaries, Mesh settings, Far field, Surface
current, Efficiency, Field plane and Solver limits) each open the **Simulation settings** dialog at
their section: Frequency, Boundaries, Mesh, Monitors and Solver, listed on its left. The dialog
edits the design at once (the preview follows, Undo reverts); **OK** keeps the changes and
**Cancel** goes back to the design as it was when the dialog opened, with its undo history (once
something was edited the button reads **Discard changes**). The Simulation tab also has the
frequency and cells per wavelength fields inline, so the common values can be changed
without the dialog.

![Simulation settings: the boundaries of the six faces on an unfolded box](designer/settings.png)

- **Frequency** (Frequency range): f min and f max of the excitation (GHz, expressions allowed).
  The mesh uses f max, the air around the model f min.
- **Boundaries**: an unfolded box of the six faces (y− faces you, z+ on top). Click a face, then
  choose its type, or set all six at once:
  - **Open (MUR)**: an open, absorbing boundary (cheap); the patch starter and the empty
    project use it;
  - **Open (PML, 8 cells)**: an open boundary that absorbs better, with 8 extra cells; the other
    starters use it;
  - **Electric wall (PEC)**: for a ground plane or an electric symmetry plane;
  - **Magnetic wall (PMC)**: for a magnetic symmetry plane.

  **Open, add space** is the air between the model and the open faces (`mesh.pad`, mm; empty: a
  quarter wavelength at f min).
- **Mesh**: the **Mesh mode** is **Automatic (recommended)** (the adaptive mode: values appear as optional
  overrides, each with the value and reason the server chose), **Classic (old)** (shown only for a
  design that already uses its cells-per-wavelength, edge-rule, cell-ratio and air-density settings)
  or **Manual lines** (only for a design
  that has them, e.g. from an example; **Switch to automatic mesh** replaces them). This section
  also shows the preview mesh, the smallest cell and a solver-time estimate. The mesher is
  described in [MESHING.md](MESHING.md). **Mesh convergence…** here (also in the ribbon's Mesh
  group) checks whether the mesh is fine enough ([Mesh convergence](#mesh-convergence)), and
  **Show the mesh view** turns the mesh view on.
  - **Thin metal** (`mesh.thin_metal`): "Model as sheets" (the default) builds every metal brick
    thinner than a tenth of the finest target cell (λ at f max / cells per wavelength / √εr of
    the densest dielectric) as a zero-thickness PEC sheet. The
    sheet goes on the face that meets the substrate (else the middle), and port and resistor ends
    inside the copper move onto it. Draw copper with its real thickness: the display and the
    exports keep it, only the mesh ignores it. At 2.45 GHz the skin depth of copper is about
    1.3 µm, so 17–70 µm changes the fields very little, but meshing it would make the timestep
    about 30 times smaller. "Mesh the thickness" keeps the volume only of plates at least 0.6 of the finest cell thick;
    thinner plates (35 µm copper) stay sheets there too, because cells across them make the timestep 30 to 60 times smaller
    and the run last 5 to 25 minutes or never converge.
- **Monitors**:
  - **Far field** (on or off) and its frequencies (empty: the |S11| minimum of each matched band), and an
    optional **Set phase center (mm)**. A design file can also set `far_field.faces`, six true/false
    flags (x−, x+, y−, y+, z−, z+) for the faces of the near-to-far-field box that record; a face
    a feed waveguide crosses is left out, as in the pyramidal horn example. There is no dialog
    field for it yet.
  - **Surface current**: frequencies at which surface-current maps are recorded on the metal
    sheets, as `fairbeam run --fields` does. After a run they are under the run's 2D/3D Results in
    the navigation tree. Ribbon Simulation › Monitors › **Surface current** opens this field; when
    the design has none yet it starts with the far-field frequencies (else the band center), which
    Cancel takes back. **Far field** next to it opens the far-field settings.
  - **Efficiency over the band** (off by default): the radiation efficiency at N frequencies
    (default 21, a whole number from 3 to 201) evenly spaced across the band, stored as
    `monitors.efficiency: {"points": N}` and in the bundle's `results.efficiency`; total efficiency
    follows with the port's S11. It is computed from the far-field box after the run, so it adds
    post-processing time, and it needs the far field: with the far field off, or
    a count outside 3–201, the `monitor-efficiency` check (browser and server) is an error that
    blocks the run. Ribbon Simulation › Monitors › **Efficiency** turns it on (Cancel takes it back)
    and opens its **Number of frequencies** field.
  - **Field planes**: up to 4 cut planes, each recording the E- or H-field magnitude (|E|, or one
    component |Ex|, |Ey|, |Ez|; the same for H) at 1 to 4 frequencies inside the band. A row sets
    the quantity, the plane normal (x, y or z), the position along it in mm (an expression, e.g.
    `h + 1`) and the frequencies; **Add field plane** and **Remove** edit the list. Stored as
    `monitors.field_planes: [{"quantity": "E", "normal": "z", "position": "h + 1", "frequencies":
    ["f0"]}]` (`"component": "x"` for one component). openEMS records a frequency-domain E or H
    dump on the mesh line nearest the position, across the whole domain; the values are peak
    phasor amplitudes in V/m or A/m for 1 W incident power at the driven port (one excitation, as
    for the surface currents). The `field-plane` check (browser and server) flags more than 4
    planes, a plane without a frequency or with more than 4, and a frequency outside the band;
    `field-plane-position` (server, it needs the domain of the preview) a position outside the
    simulation domain. All are errors that block the run. Ribbon Simulation › Monitors › **Field
    plane** adds a plane when there is none (E, normal z, 1 mm above the top of the model, at the
    far-field frequencies, else the band center; Cancel takes it back) and opens its position.
- **Solver**: the end criterion (the field-energy decay that stops the run: −40 dB is quick, −60 dB
  accurate) and the timestep limit. The end criterion is a number from −10 to −300 dB: the field,
  the `end-criterion` check (browser and server) and the run use these bounds, and a value outside
  them (−5 dB, say) is an error that blocks the run. −10 dB is Fairbeam's limit for usable results
  (above it the fields have barely decayed), not a physical one; −300 dB is the lowest a run accepts.
  Max. timesteps left empty ("auto") is chosen from the mesh: at least 60,000, the excitation pulse and its decay,
  or what about 1e11 cell-steps allow (up to 600,000), whichever is most; a run that converges stops earlier anyway.
  A thin low-loss substrate (RT5880 at 0.254 mm rings for ~50 ns, ~280,000 timesteps) needs that room;
  the `slow-ringdown` check warns when an explicit limit is below the estimated ring-down.

## Mesh view

Ribbon Simulation › **Mesh view** (or a click on the cell count in the status bar) shows the FDTD mesh
lines of the current preview on one plane and fades the solids so the lines show through. The mesh
comes from the same mesher the run uses. The panel over the 3D view has:

- the plane controls: x/y/z and a slider through the mesh lines;
- the lines per axis, the cell count, the smallest and largest cell, and the timestep;
- a **solver-time estimate**.

The estimate is cells × timesteps divided by a conservative throughput from
[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md): the M5 Pro CPU engine with 4 threads measured 318–329 MCells/s and
250 is assumed, less for small grids. The GPU engine assumes 700 MCells/s. The timesteps are 15 to 80
periods of the band center. How long a run really takes depends on how fast the field energy
decays, which is known only afterwards, so treat the range as a rough guide.

## Mesh convergence

Ribbon Simulation › Mesh › **Mesh convergence…** (or the same button in Simulation settings ›
Mesh) checks whether the mesh is fine enough. The design runs at
increasing automatic-mesh densities (cells per wavelength at f max), and each run is compared
with the previous one:

- the resonance frequency (the S11 minimum of the first matched band, else the global minimum);
- |S11| at the resonance (dB);
- Dmax at the far-field frequency closest to the resonance (only with the far field on);
- the input impedance at the resonance (shown, not part of the stopping rule).

The dialog sets:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Densities | 15, 20, 30, 40 | Cells per wavelength, coarse to fine |
| Resonance change below | 0.5 % | Tolerance of the resonance frequency |
| \|S11\| change below | 1 dB | Tolerance of \|S11\| at the resonance |
| Dmax change below | 0.2 dB | Tolerance of Dmax |
| Run limit | 4 | The study runs at most this many densities from the list (a note appears when the list is longer) |
| Engine | the Run settings | CPU or GPU, when the server has both |

The study stops at the first step whose changes are all strictly below their tolerances. It then
reports **converged at N cells/λ**, where N is the coarser density of that step: the finer run
confirms it. When the densities or the run limit are used up first, it reports **Not converged**
and names the quantity that was still moving, for example "resonance still moves 0.8 % between 30
and 40 cells/λ (limit 0.5 %)", and advises a finer density or a look at the model. A failed or
stopped run ends the study too. In the results table the **Within tolerance** column says, for each
run, whether its change from the previous run is inside every tolerance.

Before anything runs, the dialog builds a geometry preview at every density (nothing is
simulated) and shows the mesh cells and a solver-time estimate per density, and the total if every
run is needed. Above 10 minutes it warns and the button reads **Start anyway**. The estimate is
the one of the [Mesh view](#mesh-view).

**Start** saves the design (check errors block it, as for a run) and queues the first density. The
next density is queued only when the previous run is done and the rule says to continue, so a
study that converges early costs no more runs. The dialog then shows the progress (with **Stop**)
and, as the runs finish, the report: a table of every quantity and its change per density, small
plots of the resonance, |S11| and Dmax against the density (the converged density filled), and
the verdict. **Apply N cells/λ to the design** sets that density (`mesh.cells_per_wavelength`, or
the `cells_per_wavelength` override in the Auto mesh mode); Undo takes it back.

The study works with both automatic modes (Automatic (recommended) and Classic (old)). An air density set by
hand is scaled with the density. A design with manual mesh lines cannot run a study: switch to the
automatic mesh first. The runs are normal runs of the design (one bundle each, named
`<design>--mesh-<density>`), so every result view and the comparison work on them. The server
keeps the study in `studies/<id>.json` next to the bundles ([STUDIES.md](STUDIES.md)); the same
study runs from the command line with `fairbeam converge <design>.design.json`.

## Running and results

**Run** (Simulation tab, the Run button in the header, or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter) opens the **Run the
simulation** dialog:

- **Engine**: **CPU (multi-threaded)**, or **GPU (Metal or CUDA build)** when the server has that
  build ([GPU.md](GPU.md)).
- **Threads** for the CPU engine (4 is a good default).
- **S-parameter sample points**: the S-parameter samples over the band (801 by default, 11 to
  20001).
- **Result name**: leave blank to keep a unique bundle for every run (model id plus run suffix). A run never replaces an earlier one: a name that is already taken gets a short id added.

The dialog also shows the solver-time estimate (with one run per excited port when there are
several). Its **Run** button (**Save and run** when there are unsaved changes) saves first. It
refuses while the Checks list has errors: the dialog lists them, and a click goes to the field.
A check that knows the fix offers a button, here as in the Checks list (see below): for example,
when the excitation pulse alone needs more timesteps than the limit, **Set max timesteps to N**
raises the limit (times are shown as 1.18 ps, not 1.18e+03 fs). While the run is blocked the dialog
shows no time estimate.
**Optimize…** opens the optimizer instead.

![A finished run: the S-parameters open as a tab beside the 3D view, with markers, and the dock's Runs tab](../landing/media/designer-sparams.jpg)

The run's progress appears in the dock's **Run** tab (and as "Running N %" in the status bar):

- the phases;
- the timestep, the speed, the field energy against the end criterion, the elapsed time and an
  estimate of the time remaining;
- a convergence chart;
- a **Cancel** button.

The 3D view keeps showing the design, and you can go on editing (the run uses the saved file).

**Run quality.** Every finished run gets a verdict (`src/lib/runQuality.ts`): *converged*, *not
converged* (it stopped at the timestep limit, so S11 and the far field may be wrong) or *suspicious*
(|S11| above 0 dB, a radiation efficiency above 100 %, or a port that is not coupled: |S11| of
-0.5 dB or higher over the whole band and/or a total efficiency under 2 % in every far-field entry,
typically a feed that no longer spans a gap after the geometry was rotated). "Converged" only means
the field energy reached the end criterion; it says nothing about the match. A run that is not clean shows an amber
banner over its result tabs and in the Run tab, with the reason and what to change (raise max
timesteps or relax the end criterion; refine the mesh, move the boundaries away or lower the end
criterion; see the efficiency note), and a warning badge in the navigation tree and the Runs table.
When a run finishes without converging, the dock stays on its Run tab.

When the run finishes, it appears under Results in the navigation tree (runs finished in the Run
panel too). Its result views open as tabs beside the 3D view, from the tree's result nodes or the
Post-processing tab; the dock's **Runs** tab lists the design's runs and **Log** holds the
openEMS output. Each run row in the tree carries its headline numbers (resonance, |S11|
minimum and Dmax) under its name, and the Runs table has columns for the resonance, |S11| minimum,
−10 dB bandwidth, Dmax and total efficiency (from the run's bundle; a run not read yet shows the
frequency of its band's |S11| minimum from the project index):

- **Summary** (tree: Tables › Summary, or Post-processing › Summary): the run card. The converged
  banner (a run that is not clean shows the quality banner above it), the headline numbers
  (resonance, |S11| minimum, −10 dB bandwidth, Dmax, realized gain and total efficiency at the far
  field nearest the resonance), the matched bands, the far-field values, and what the solver did.
  With several runs selected it is a table with one row per run and a column for each parameter that
  differs between them; each run's difference from the **Reference run** is shown under (or, in
  the Δ view, over) the value. The reference is the oldest selected run by default (run A when it
  is selected) and can be chosen above the table; **Copy data** and **CSV** write the same table
  (English headers, decimal points) with Δ columns against that run and its name in the last one.
  A run whose |S11| minimum is at the edge of the band with nothing below −10 dB has no resonance:
  Summary, the Runs table, the tree and Properties say "no resonance in band (minimum at the band
  edge)", and a mesh convergence study of such runs reports its steps as not comparable instead of
  converged.
- **S-parameters**: |S11| with the −10 dB bands, or the driven column of the S-matrix for
  several ports. The side panel lists each matched band: its best match (the frequency of the |S11|
  minimum), the minimum |S11|, its center (the middle of the band edges), its range and its
  bandwidth. A band that continues past the simulated range is marked ≤ / ≥ at its open edge, and
  its width is a lower bound.
- **Impedance**, **VSWR** and **Smith**: the input impedance, the VSWR (2:1 marked) and the
  reflection on a Smith chart.
- **Efficiency**: the mismatch efficiency 1 − |S11|² over the band (% or dB), with the radiation
  efficiency and the total efficiency (radiation × mismatch) as points at the far-field frequencies;
  one color per quantity, or per driven port for multi-port runs. The radiation efficiency is only
  known where openEMS computed a far field (add frequencies under Simulation › Monitors › Far
  field); a run that stores it over the band (`results.efficiency`) draws it, and the total
  efficiency, as curves. Values above 100 % are unphysical and flagged. Where the port accepts only
  a few % of the incident power, the efficiency depends on how far the ring-down had decayed when
  the run stopped; values whose accepted power is uncertain by more than 10 % are left out of the
  curves and drawn as flagged points, with a note (a lower end criterion, e.g. −70 dB, makes more
  of the band reliable; [BUNDLE.md](BUNDLE.md#efficiency) has the measurements).
- **Pattern** (with a far field): the φ = 0° and φ = 90° cuts of the chosen quantity with Dmax,
  gain, realized gain, radiation and total efficiency and the main-lobe direction; one chip per
  far-field frequency. **Show in 3D** in the tab's toolbar draws the same far field as a 3D pattern
  in the 3D view.
- **Surface current** (with a monitor): a tree node per frequency, or Post-processing › **Currents**;
  the map itself is drawn in the 3D view.
- **Field plane** (with field planes): each map has two nodes under 2D/3D Results, **… · 2D map**
  and **… · 3D**. The 3D node (or the ribbon's Post-processing › **Field plane**, the run's first
  map) draws the map in the 3D view as one semi-transparent heat-map plane at its true position.
  The color bar at the top right names the map and the driven port, and switches between **dB**
  (0 dB = the map's maximum, 40 dB range) and **Linear** (0 to the maximum, in V/m or A/m). Maps are
  recorded in the run; changing the planes needs a new run.
- **Field map** (with field planes): the **2D map** node, or Post-processing › **Field map**, opens
  the same map as a heat map in a main-area tab: axes in mm at one scale, the color bar with
  **dB** / **Linear**, the projection of the model's parts onto the plane as an outline (solid for
  metal, dashed for dielectrics; **Structure outline** turns it off), and a readout of the value
  under the pointer (or, with the map focused, under the arrow keys; Shift moves ten samples,
  Escape clears it). A **Map** picker switches between the run's maps and **Show in 3D** draws the
  map in the 3D view. Copy data and CSV give one row per sample: u and v in mm, the magnitude,
  and (with phase data) the real part, imaginary part and phase in degrees of each stored
  component; English headers, decimal points. Runs made before phase data existed show the
  magnitude only, with a note.
  - **Phase and Animate** (the 2D tab and the 3D color bar share them): **Phase** colors the
    phase of one component against the incident wave of the driven port (a cyclic color scale,
    gray where the field is too weak to have a phase; for a map of |E| the strongest component,
    or pick Ex, Ey or Ez under **Component**). **Animate** shows the instantaneous field
    Re{F·e^(jωt)} over one period: a component as a signed value (blue-light-red), a map of |E| as
    the instantaneous magnitude |E(t)|. **Play** steps the period in 24 frames (one second
    per cycle) and pauses when the page is hidden or the system asks for reduced motion (the slider
    still steps through it); the 3D view redraws the same plane at each instant. The dB / Linear
    scale applies to magnitudes only.
  - **Examples**: in the Examples viewer, a bundle with field planes lists them under **Field
    plane** in the model panel; the chosen map is drawn in the 3D view with the same color bar,
    phase and animation.
- **Table**: frequency, |S11|, VSWR and the impedance.
- **Log** (dock): the openEMS output (the end of it for an earlier run), with a link to the full log.

The far-field **quantity** (Directivity, Gain, Realized gain, and RHCP/LHCP directivity when the
run has circular-polarisation data) is chosen in the Pattern tab's side panel, in the far-field card
of the 3D view, or under **Post-processing › Farfield › Quantity** while a pattern is shown; the
choice holds for the session. Gain is the directivity plus 10·log10(η_rad), realized gain the directivity plus
10·log10(η_rad·(1 − |S11(f)|²)) with the driven port's S11 at the far-field frequency, so their
maxima are the bundle's `gain_dbi` and `realized_gain_dbi`. Without a radiation efficiency the
gain options are disabled (the tooltip says why) and the pattern stays directivity.

While the **3D pattern** is shown, a card at the top right of the 3D view holds its color scale,
the quantity, the far-field frequency chips (and driven port for multi-port runs), Dmax, gain,
realized gain, radiation, mismatch and total efficiency and the main-lobe direction θ, φ. Its
chevron folds it to the color scale alone. A multi-port array shows the array pattern (all ports
fed), which has directivity only.

Another run opens from the tree. The header's exports (**Export package**, **Export VBA macro**)
and Post-processing › PDF report / Package take the run shown. The ✕ at the right end of a result
tab's toolbar closes the shown run (its result tabs and the dock's Runs and Log tabs); the ✕ on a
tab closes that tab only. Each tab's toolbar also has **Compare**, the data-format menu, **Copy
data**, **CSV** and **Touchstone**.

### Working with more than one project

The editor currently has one active design. Save it before opening another design from Start;
each file keeps its own saved geometry and result associations, but reopening starts a new
Undo/Redo history. The result tabs are views of the selected run, not independent project editors.

In a result tab, **Compare** groups the current design's runs separately from other projects.
Select another project's saved result to overlay it without replacing the active design or its
primary result. Up to eight runs can be compared. Project and run labels distinguish the curves
and exported data. Results load only when selected; failed loads offer Retry or Remove, and
figure capture waits until the selected comparison is ready. Switching designs clears the
comparison. Independent editable project tabs and side-by-side project windows are not yet
implemented.

The standalone Results viewer also compares indexed results through its **Compare** control.
Submitted simulations continue on the server while another project is viewed; the queue runs
one solver at a time. New designer runs, sweeps, optimization and mesh-convergence studies use
a checked copy of the saved design captured at submission. Later edits do not change that
queued input. Python models and older jobs still use their original paths; keep those sources
unchanged while queued. See [admitted design inputs](QUEUED-DESIGN-INPUTS.md) for exact scope.
The [multiple-project plan](MULTI-PROJECT-PLAN.md) records the state, window and
session work still required for independent editors.

Sweeps and the optimizer start from the Optimize tab (**Parameter sweep**, **Optimizer**) and
their runs appear under Results in the tree. Python models use the Run panel instead
([RUN-SERVER.md](RUN-SERVER.md), [OPTIMIZE.md](OPTIMIZE.md)), where a design also shows up under
its name like any model.

A new sweep axis starts as the parameter's current value ±10 % in 5 steps (never its whole range),
and picks a geometric parameter, not the design frequency; choosing another parameter re-seeds the
range. The optimizer's first parameter is also a geometric one, with bounds of the current value
±20 %.

The optimizer checks every candidate of a design before it simulates it. A candidate with check
errors, or one whose values make metal overhang its substrate or float in the air
(`metal-overhang`, `metal-floating` that the design at its own values does not have), is not
simulated: the evaluations table lists it as **Skipped** with the reason (for example
"'patch' overhangs 'substrate' by 1.2 mm (x+)"), it costs at least the failed-evaluation penalty,
and the search goes on. Sweeps run every point as it is.

## Files

- **Where**: designs are saved in the run server's models folder, next to the Python models.
  Repository checkout: `python/models/`. Desktop app: `models/` in the workspace, `~/Documents/Fairbeam`
  on macOS and `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Fairbeam` on Windows.
- **Saving**: every save keeps the previous version in `model-history/`. If the file changed on disk
  since it was opened, the designer says so; saving again overwrites it with your version.
- **Format**: `fairbeam.design/1`, one JSON object, documented at the top of
  `python/fairbeam/design.py` (all shape kinds, waveguide ports, transforms, cuts and components).

    ],

  }
  ```

  `f0`, `W`, `L` and `h` are independent parameters; `lam` and `G` are derived (a derived
  parameter may use the ones above it). `monitors` is optional. `monitors.currents` makes
  `fairbeam run` record surface currents at those frequencies without a `--fields` flag;
  `monitors.efficiency: {"points": 21}` adds the efficiency over the band, as `--efficiency 21`;
  `monitors.field_planes` records E/H maps on cut planes, as `--field-plane`.
- **Example designs**: [examples/designs/](../examples/designs/README.md) holds designs to copy into
  your models folder, all for UAV telemetry at 867 MHz: a slotted wideband
  planar dipole, a printed meander dipole for airframes without a metal skin, a printed sleeve
  dipole, a printed 2-element collinear and a ground-station 5-element Yagi, each with its results
  and how to scale it to other bands. The desktop app installs them in the workspace's models folder,
  read-only, as the sources of the 867 MHz examples: **Open as new design…** on one of them makes an
  editable copy. Their IDs, like those of the bundled Python models, are reserved for them.
  The retired Blade antenna remains a research fixture; it is not installed as a gallery example.
- **Copies of examples**: a copy of a bundled Python example keeps the example's description, the
  names and labels of its solids and the names of its materials. What the conversion did (the
  parameters it carried over, the ones it fixed) is in `model.conversion`, shown as **Conversion
  notes** in the design's Properties.
- **Command line**: a design runs like a model file:
  `fairbeam run python/models/my_patch.design.json --set W=30` ([CLI.md](CLI.md)).
- **Python export**: ribbon Post-processing › Report and export › **Python** (also File › Export
  › Python… in the desktop app) opens the **Python source** panel in place of Properties: the
  design as an equivalent Python model file (`MODEL`, `PARAMS`, `build`), for hand editing or for
  features that designs do not have yet ([MODELS.md](MODELS.md)). **Copy** puts it on the
  clipboard, **Save…** writes the `.py` file, and **Refresh source** appears when design edits have
  made it out of date. It builds the same geometry and mesh.
- **Edit and Apply**: **Edit** in the Python panel turns the script into an editor (line numbers,
  Python highlighting, Tab indents). **Apply** (or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter) sends it to the run server, which
  builds the geometry without running the solver and replaces the design's solids, materials, ports,
  parameters, mesh, simulation and far field with the result, in **one undo step**. The design keeps
  its name and id. The script is read back with the same converter as the bundled Python examples, so
  its rules apply: exact primitives only, coordinates that are linear in the parameters become
  expressions, the other numbers stay numbers, and a parameter that drives nothing is dropped. After
  Apply the panel writes the script again from the new design; when that script builds the same
  design your text stays, otherwise it is replaced and the panel says the script was normalized.
  A failure (a Python exception, a syntax error, an unsupported feature, a time-out) comes back with
  its line: the editor marks the line, the message shows under the header and the design is not
  touched. **Done** with changes that were not applied asks before discarding them.
  Edit needs a connected run server, because it runs your Python on your computer: the web demo shows
  the button disabled with the reason. The script runs in a child process with a 20 s limit and a
  512 KB size limit, one at a time, and `FDTD.Run` / `Simulation.run` raise instead of starting the
  solver. This is not a sandbox: the script can do whatever Python can, so apply only your own code.

## Importing a VBA macro

**Import VBA macro…** (Start screen, Home › Project › Import macro, File › Import VBA macro…) reads a
CST-compatible VBA macro (`.bas`, `.mcs`) or a history list saved as text and shows the import
report before anything is saved: what was created, and every command that was not imported or was
changed on the way, with its line. Name the design and **Create and open** saves it and opens it
here. The command line does the same: `fairbeam import-cst model.bas --out my.design.json`.

What is read (`python/fairbeam/cst_import.py`, `SUPPORTED`): units; parameters (`StoreParameter`,
`MakeSureParameterExists`, ...) as design parameters, a value as an independent one and an
expression as a derived one (VBA `^`, `Sqr`, `Atn`, `Mod`, `\`, `Pi`, `clight`, ... translated, and the degree
functions `Sind`, `Cosd`, `Tand`, `Asind`, `Acosd` and `Atnd`, whose angles and results are in degrees);
materials (Normal: εr and tan δ, a conductivity as the equivalent tan δ; PEC; lossy metals as PEC,
with a note); bricks, cylinders and tubes, cones, spheres, tori, polygons and rectangles or circles
covered or extruded, point-list extrusions; `Solid.ThickenSheetAdvanced` on a planar sheet (Inside,
Outside or Centered, taken relative to the sheet's face normal); a straight `Loft` (zero tangency) between two
convex, parallel sheets of the same outline, as a polyhedron; components; `Solid.Add` (a union), `Solid.Subtract`,
`Intersect` and `Insert` as live Booleans where the designer's Booleans can hold them (bricks,
sheets, polygons); transforms (translate, rotations by any angle, mirror, uniform scale, with copies);
axis-aligned local working coordinate systems; the frequency range, boundaries, the mesh density
(lines per wavelength), discrete ports, resistors, waveguide ports with given ranges, far-field and
H-field monitors. Coordinates are converted to mm and rounded to 1e-6 mm, the precision of the
mesh lines, so ports sit on mesh lines. VBA code itself (variables, `If`, `For`) is not run.

No shape is dropped silently: every object or operation that cannot be imported is named in the report
(for example a `Loft` with tangency or non-matching profiles). A loft that cannot be imported keeps its
profile sheets, and the dialog warns that the geometry is incomplete, so rebuild the connecting solid
before simulating.

Mesh density is read from `Mesh.LinesPerWavelength` and from `MeshSettings` blocks explicitly
marked `SetMeshType "Hex"` or `"HexTLM"`. In those blocks, `StepsPerWaveNear` sets cells per
wavelength and `StepsPerWaveFar` sets air cells per wavelength only when positive and lower than
the near density. Tetrahedral, surface, unknown and unspecified mesh types do not set FDTD density:
their steps per wavelength are ignored. Without a supported density, Fairbeam uses its automatic
mesh default of 20 cells per wavelength. A supported hexahedral density is retained even if an
unsupported block appears later in the VBA macro. The import report explains the mapping or the
ignored density settings; review the mesh and design checks before running a simulation.

A macro exported by Fairbeam carries comments starting with `fairbeam-data:` with the exact
openEMS port boxes, the boundary types and the automatic mesh settings (other readers ignore them), so
exporting a design and importing the macro gives the same model back
(`python/tests/test_cst_import.py`). They are used only where they agree with the macro commands next
to them.

## Importing PCB artwork (DXF/Gerber)

`fairbeam import-pcb`, and the **Import PCB artwork…** dialog (below), turn the 2D artwork of a
printed antenna into a design (`python/fairbeam/pcb_import.py`). It reads ASCII **DXF** (closed polylines, `CIRCLE`, `ARC`,
`ELLIPSE`, and lines, arcs and open polylines that meet end to end, which are joined into loops),
**Gerber RS-274X** (regions, flashes of the standard apertures, draws with round or rectangular
apertures as outlines, arcs) and **Excellon** drill files (plated holes become metal pins between
the two copper planes). No extra Python packages are needed.

```
fairbeam import-pcb patch.dxf --out my.design.json --layer-map TOP=top_copper,BOT=bottom_copper
fairbeam import-pcb board.gtl board.gbl board.gko board.drl --substrate RO4003C --thickness 0.813
```

- **Layers.** Each copper layer becomes a part of `polygon` sheets on a z plane: top copper at
  z = `h` (the substrate thickness, a parameter), bottom copper at z = 0. Layers are recognized by
  name (F.Cu, Top, GTL, Edge.Cuts, Profile ...) or by the Gerber X2 file function; `--layer-map
  NAME=role` overrides that, with the roles `top_copper`, `bottom_copper`, `outline`, `ignore`,
  `top_clearance` and `bottom_clearance` (a layer name, file name or pattern on the left). A file
  with a single unrecognized layer of outlines is taken as top copper, with a warning.
- **Clearances.** A layer named after a copper layer with `_Antipad` (or "clearance"), as
  Fairbeam's own fab export writes them (`B_Cu_Antipad`), is the clearance of that copper: its
  circles and outlines are cut out of the copper as holes. Fairbeam's fab DXF and Gerber files
  therefore read back with the anti-pad round the probe in the ground plane.
- **Substrate.** A box over the board outline (the Edge.Cuts / Profile layer), else the copper's
  bounding box plus `--margin` (2 mm). `--substrate` takes a library name (FR4, RO4003C ...) or a
  name with `--eps-r` and `--tan-d`; tan δ is applied at the design frequency `f0` (`--f0`, default
  2.45 GHz; the band is 0.6 to 1.3 f0). The board center is moved to x = y = 0 (`--origin keep`
  leaves the file's coordinates; the report gives the offset).
- **Units.** DXF: `$INSUNITS` (mm assumed, with one warning for all the files that lack it;
  `--units mm|inch` forces). Gerber and Excellon files carry their own.
- **Curves.** Arcs and circles are tessellated so that no chord is more than `--chord-tol` (0.02 mm)
  from the curve.
- **Holes.** CSXCAD polygons have no holes, so a loop inside a loop (a Gerber aperture hole, a clear
  (LPC) circle flash or region inside one dark region, a clearance layer's circle) makes the copper
  part a **live Boolean subtraction** (outlines minus holes, see Cuts above): the
  stored sheets are the exact difference, and the operands stay editable. An island inside a hole
  is a separate part (`top_copper_islands`).
- **Ports.** None: the importer cannot know the feed. The report says "add a port at the feed".

The **import report** (printed by the command) lists the layers and their roles, what was created
and every entity that was not imported, with its line and the reason: text, hatches, splines, block
references, open paths that do not close, self-crossing outlines, Gerber aperture macros, clear
polarity objects other than circle flashes and regions inside one dark region, step and repeat,
unplated holes, routed slots.

### The Import PCB artwork dialog

**Import PCB artwork…** (Start screen, Home › Project › Import PCB, File › Import PCB Artwork… in the
desktop app) does the same with a form. Choose the files or drop them on the dialog (up to 12 files,
8 MB each and 16 MB together; they are read in the page and sent to the run server, which saves
nothing until you create the design).

- **Layers.** A table lists every layer of the files (a DXF layer, or a Gerber or drill file) with
  what it holds, a **role** dropdown (top copper, bottom copper, board outline, ignore, clearance in
  the top or bottom copper; a drill file is drills or ignored) and why that role was picked: the layer name, the Gerber file function, the
  Excellon file, or your choice. A layer whose name gives no hint shows "Unclear: not used" and
  is highlighted; pick its role. Each change imports again, so the report always matches the table.
  The arrow next to a role you chose goes back to the importer's pick. A map entry names a DXF layer
  in every DXF file, so two files with a layer of the same name share its role.
- **Substrate.** A material from the library (FR4, RO4003C ... or Custom), the thickness (mm), εr,
  tan δ and the design frequency f0 (GHz). Picking a material fills εr and tan δ; the values shown
  are the ones the design gets. **Advanced**: the units of DXF files, the arc chord tolerance, the
  margin used when no layer is the board outline, and center or keep the file's origin.
- **Report.** The entries that were not imported come first, then warnings and notes, then the
  design checks (the missing port is left out of them: the dialog says so itself). The summary lists
  the roles guessed from layer names instead of "everything was imported", and notes that name a
  command-line flag are worded for the dialog's own controls (Advanced › Units of DXF files,
  Advanced › Origin, the Layers table). The proposed name is the stem the files share without their
  layer suffixes (`export_patch` for `export_patch-F_Cu.dxf`, `export_patch-B_Cu.dxf` ...). Name the
  design and **Create and open** it.
- **Port.** The importer cannot know the feed, so a new design has no port. After the design opens,
  the dialog shows "Add a port at the feed" with a button that goes to Simulation › Ports › Lumped
  and adds a lumped port to move to the feed.

The server side is `POST /api/import/pcb` (`{files: [{name, content_base64}], options: {layer_map,
substrate, thickness, eps_r, tan_d, f0, units, chord_tol, margin, origin}}`, answering `{design,
report, layers, checks}`), and `POST /api/designs` with `pcb: {files, options}` creates the file.
Other files, bad numbers or too many files answer 422 (413 beyond the size limits).

## Scenario checks

Focused checks are `npm run check:eta-presentation` and `npm run check:run-profiles`
(pure logic), plus `npm run check:modal-focus` and `npm run check:run-profile-dialog` (temporary
Vite/run-server stacks, Chrome and the Python runtime with openEMS required; no solver runs).
The opt-in `scripts/check-home-accessibility.mjs` uses intercepted API fixtures against a running
Vite server; see its header for environment variables. It covers compact layouts, the header menu,
project search/sort/favorites, failure states, and desktop panel preference restoration.

`npm run check:scenarios` drives realistic first-time tasks through the real UI in headless Chrome,
each in English and in Turkish, and stops on the first thing a user would trip over. It is heavier
than `check:designer` (about 3 minutes, one coarse solver run) and is not part of it.

- **S1** builds a patch from the empty design using only the UI: an FR4 brick, a ground sheet and a
  patch, a slot cut with right-click › Boolean › Subtract ›, a mirrored solid through the Transform dialog's
  live preview, the face-extrude preview, a discrete port and the band, Color… on a solid and on a
  component, Save and a reload, then **one coarse run** (see below) and its S-parameters and Summary.
- **S2** imports a VBA macro (`examples/cst/patch-antenna.bas`) and PCB artwork
  (`python/tests/fixtures/pcb/*.gtl, *.gko`) and checks that the solids and the report appear.
- **S3** opens the Sweep dialog (the default range is ±10 %, the submission is captured, never
  sent), the Optimizer (its validation messages) and Simulation settings (Discard).
- **S4** copies two bundled example bundles as runs of a design (one with a synthetic field map) and
  checks the Summary with Δ vs A, Copy data and CSV, the run's Properties, the Field map with Phase
  and Animate, and Retry after a failed result load.
- **S5** opens the Python panel, edits a parameter value in the script and Applies it (one undo step),
  applies a script that raises (the line is named and the design stays) and leaves Edit with unapplied
  changes (the confirmation).
- **S6** creates a Python model from Start, opens its linked Design with the source in the Python
  panel, then returns to Start and confirms **Open as Design** reuses that Design without making a
  duplicate.
- **S7** checks repeated transform previews, a single Apply and undo, component-wide transforms,
  moving parts between component folders, independent grid visibility and local drawing frames.

Every step asserts the expected state and audits the page: no element overflows its container, no
clipped text without a tooltip, no raw i18n keys, no dialog outside the window, and no console error
or warning (which includes the `[i18n]` missing-key warning). A failing step saves a screenshot
under `$TMPDIR/fairbeam-scenario-failures/`. The audit checks itself first on a page with known faults.

The runner starts Vite and a run server on free ports over a temp folder (a copy of `public/` whose
`projects/` is also the server's `--projects`, because Vite serves result files from its public
folder while the server writes into `--projects`; a folder elsewhere fails to load, see
[RUN-SERVER.md](RUN-SERVER.md)) and stops both by PID at the end. The solver run takes the
`/tmp/fairbeam-sim.lock` directory (`mkdir` takes it, `rmdir` releases it) and runs at `nice -n 10`; when
the lock is held, or with `--skip-run`, the run is skipped. Options: `S1 S3` (only those scenarios),
`--lang en|tr`, `--skip-run`; `FAIRBEAM_CHROME` and `FAIRBEAM_PYTHON` point at another Chrome or
python. The checks that a browser cannot do are in [DESKTOP-CHECKLIST.md](DESKTOP-CHECKLIST.md).

## Known limitations

- **Lossless horn power balance.** The shipped pyramidal horn is marked lossless. Its reported
  radiation efficiency is 100 % by construction when the measured power balance passes the
  solver's tolerance; this is not an independent accuracy check. Inspect `rad_efficiency_raw`
  (radiated power / accepted port power), the QA notes and mesh convergence before using gain.
  A finer mesh can change the port probes and NF2FF power balance. Results outside the tolerance
  retain the measured efficiency and a QA warning.
- **Unsigned Windows installer.** The macOS app is signed and notarized and opens with
  a double-click, but the Windows installer is not code-signed: SmartScreen warns on the first run
  (More info › Run anyway; [DESKTOP.md](DESKTOP.md)).

## Feedback

Reports and ideas go to the public issue tracker,
[fairbeam-releases](https://github.com/ismailakdag/fairbeam-releases/issues), which opens in your
browser:

- The start screen's footer has **Report a problem** (the bug form, with the app version and your
  operating system filled in) and **Suggest a feature**.
- The speech-bubble button in the header (**Send feedback**) opens the list of both forms.

The app sends nothing by itself and puts nothing else into the link. Attach the design file or a log
if they help, and remove anything private first. In the desktop app the local run server opens the
system browser, since the app window does not open web pages itself.

### Outline corner round and bevel

Right-click a rectangular sheet or brick (or its selected shape) and choose **Round / bevel
outline corners…**. Select an axis and a radius or setback. For a sheet the axis must be its
normal. For a brick the four edges parallel to that axis are treated; the top and bottom rims
remain sharp. The size must be positive and less than half the shorter outline side.

This is a geometric operation: bevels become eight-point polygons and rounds use 16 chords per
quarter circle. Sheets become native polygons and bricks become native polygon extrusions. The
preview, mesh, Python and geometry exports use those same points. Apply stores the evaluated
dimensions at the current parameter values, retains the part's material and transforms and is
one undo step. Cuts and live Boolean history must first be materialized. Arbitrary 3D edge
fillets, top/bottom rim blends and free-form CAD surfaces are not supported by this tool.

Right-click **Components** and choose **New component** to create and name an empty folder.
Folders are saved even while empty. Drag parts onto the folder or use **Move to component**
in their context menu. Folder operations affect organization; each part keeps its own material
and ordered transforms. The Transform panel shows actual translucent result surfaces even when
coplanar with the original, with a rotation-axis/center or mirror-plane reference.
### Deliberate RF setup

The Ports and Lumped elements **+** actions open a creation form. Enter both endpoints, the
current/propagation direction and the electrical settings; **Create** commits one undo step.
Cancel leaves the design unchanged. Discrete ports use a small direction arrow in the viewport.
Existing ports and elements remain editable in Properties, including picked endpoints.

A discrete port's physical openEMS source/termination uses a positive real resistance. Its
optional **Complex power-wave reference** is postprocessing metadata: the Kurokawa
coefficient is `(Zin - conj(Zref)) / (Zin + Zref)`, requiring `Re Zref > 0`. The Impedance result
shows the match and `1 - |Γ|²` at the middle frequency sample. Raw result bundles retain separate
complex power-wave coefficients across the frequency grid. Native S-parameters, their Smith
chart, the physical source and multiport matrices retain their original real reference. This
reference does not install a physical load. For a passive equivalent circuit, use an
R/L/C load; a constant imaginary impedance is not a broadband causal time-domain element.

Lumped elements support any positive R (Ω), L (H) and C (F) combination, with absent branches
left empty, and **Series** or **Parallel** topology. Native RLC requires CSXCAD/openEMS 0.37 or
later; older runtimes report the limitation instead of approximating it. Saved `resistors`
arrays still work, with optional `L`, `C` and `topology` fields. Python export and readback retain
them. The VBA macro exports every element as a `LumpedElement` with its R, L and C (a zero value is an
absent component) as a series or parallel RLC, and the macro import reads them back.
The [RF validation record](benchmarks/rf-rlc-workflows/README.md) distinguishes native API support
from circuit-response agreement: the tested parallel circuit passed its 10% criterion, while
the series circuit did not. Series numerical accuracy remains an open validation item.

Waveguide setup supports the rectangular TE modes offered by openEMS, with explicit aperture,
excitation/probe endpoints and propagation direction. General Bloch/Floquet ports, oblique
periodic excitation and higher diffraction-order extraction are not implemented. A normal
incidence PEC/PMC unit-cell fixture is a restricted symmetry model, not general Floquet support.

Dielectrics also expose positive isotropic, loss-free, frequency-independent relative
permeability μr. Magnetic loss, anisotropic tensors and dispersive ferrites are not represented.

Native APIs: [CSXCAD RLC properties](https://docs.openems.de/en/latest/concepts/properties.html);
reference convention: [scikit-rf power-wave definitions](https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/networktheory/Working%20with%20Complex%20Characteristic%20Impedances.html).

### Export the current view

The header's **Export…** menu follows the visible workspace. In Design's 3D tab, it offers
geometry formats, the current unsaved design JSON and Python. Geometry export is unavailable
for an empty design. In a result tab, CSV and Touchstone use the toolbar's current result,
S-parameter selection and comparisons. Figure SVG and PNG capture the plotted charts with
their visible quantities and traces. In Drawing, the menu uses that drawing's SVG, PDF and PNG
export actions. A format without data is disabled with the reason in its tooltip.

The camera button and View ribbon Screenshot capture the visible 3D view, chart or technical
drawing. They are disabled on Start and for empty geometry or a result view without a supported
figure. They never capture a hidden 3D canvas behind a result tab or drawing. Download requests,
saved paths, cancellations and errors also appear in the app's global notice.

### Rendered view and Render image

The 3D view's **Rendered** button (next to the camera presets, and in the View ribbon's Render
group) shows the design as a render: physically based materials, a studio environment with key,
fill and rim light, a soft ground shadow, and the ports. Copper, gold, silver, tin, nickel,
aluminium, brass and steel are metallic with their own colour and roughness; a PEC or an unknown
metal is copper. FR-4 is a translucent yellow-green laminate, Rogers, Taconic and PTFE laminates
are cream, alumina is white, any other dielectric is a neutral beige; air, vacuum and cut-outs are
not drawn. A part's own **Color** wins over these defaults and keeps the metallic finish. A
material is recognised by its name or library entry in the designer, and by its conductivity,
permittivity and loss in a result or an example (the bundle does not carry names). The table is
`src/render/materials.ts`, plain data that the Blender renderer mirrors.

Orbit, pan, zoom and the camera presets work as usual, edits update the render, and switching back
restores the modelling view exactly (selection, see-through dielectrics, edges). The same button is
in the Results and Examples 3D view. The toolbar under the presets sets the ports (**Connector**: an
SMA where one fits, otherwise the marker; **Marker**: a small red bead and rod; **Hidden**), the ground
shadow, a green solder mask on PCB laminates, and a dark background.

A connector fits a lumped port that feeds through a board: at a board edge (within about 2 mm or 3 %
of the board) an edge-launch SMA points out of that edge with its pin on the trace; otherwise, with
free space beyond a ground plane, a bottom-mount SMA sits under the ground plane with its pin up the
port. A dipole's gap in free air, a port between two traces, and a ground plane smaller than the
6.35 mm hex get the marker. Waveguide ports show a thin flange outline, lumped elements a small
SMD body.

**Render image…** (View ribbon, the rendered-view toolbar and the header's **Export…** menu) draws
pictures offscreen and saves PNGs into the workspace folder `renders/<design-id>/` as
`<design>_<angle>_<timestamp>.png` (a taken name gets `-2`, `-3`, so no render is overwritten; with no
server the browser's download is used). Angles: Isometric, Top, Front, Right, Back, Left, Bottom and the
current view, any number in one go. Resolution: 1920×1080, 3840×2160 or custom (64 to 8192 px).
Background: transparent, studio or dark. Also ports, solder mask, ground shadow, perspective or
orthographic, and a quality (Draft: none, Standard: 2×, High: 3× supersampling, always with
multisampling and held to the GPU's limits). The pictures show as thumbnails with **Copy image**; **Open
folder** opens the folder in the system's file manager. The renderer and its code load on first use.

### RF creation and Python folder metadata

Ports and passive R/L/C elements open a creation form before editing the design. The form
keeps endpoints explicit, separates the real source resistance from a complex power-wave
reference, and reports waveguide cutoff and unsupported Floquet/Bloch workflows. Native
series RLC remains available with an inline numerical-validation limitation in creation
and Properties (see `docs/benchmarks/rf-rlc-workflows`).

Python export writes `FAIRBEAM_ORGANIZATION`, containing only optional `components`
folder paths and part-name-to-component assignments. Import/apply restores assignments
using the actual source CSXCAD property of each read-back group, only when that
property name is unique. Rotated copies split into groups keep their source folder;
a literal name ending in `[2]` is never interpreted as a copy. Removed or
renamed parts are not recreated from metadata. Python modules without this constant retain
the existing import behavior. Folder-list paths must be non-empty slash-separated names;
legacy part paths retain their existing empty-segment warning.

The optional target-impedance load helper in RLC creation converts target `Z = R + jX` at a
positive reference frequency into a physical passive parallel equivalent. With
`ω = 2πf`, it fills `Rp = (R² + X²)/R`, and either `C = -X/[ω(R² + X²)]`
for negative reactance or `L = (R² + X²)/(ωX)` for positive reactance. Zero
reactance gives only the resistor. The target requires positive R; component
values remain SI Ω/H/F. This matches only at the selected frequency, does not
create a constant broadband imaginary impedance, and never changes the port's
power-wave reference. Filling is local to the form; Create is one undoable edit.

### Minimum-window scenario check

`node scripts/check-scenarios.mjs S8 S9 S10 --compact --skip-run` runs EN/TR
Appearance, visible-surface exports and RF forms at the native desktop minimum.
The Rust window fit uses 1024 × 700 logical points, reduced to 1024 × 688 on a
728-point work area after title-bar allowance. RF forms run at both heights;
Cancel/Create actions must remain inside the modal and reachable onscreen by Tab.
At these widths the navigation/properties panels are overlays: scenarios open their
real edge strips when needed. The default scenario dimensions and step count stay unchanged.
No FDTD solve is requested by this command.

`node scripts/check-scenarios.mjs S9 --compact --skip-run --ribbon-file-audit`
also checks View/Simulation icon alignment at 1024, 1280 and 1440 pixels in EN/TR,
and opens an actual result bundle through More's file chooser. The extra check is opt-in.
