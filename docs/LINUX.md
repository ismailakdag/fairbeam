# Fairbeam on Linux from source

This setup runs the CPU openEMS solver, the Python run server and the built Fairbeam viewer in a
local browser. It is a source/development setup, with a user-owned runtime prefix. It does not
produce a native Tauri app, `.deb`, AppImage, updater package or public release.

## Native desktop readiness

The source workflow below was tested on Debian 13 x86_64. An experimental Tauri `.deb` also passed
build and package-content checks on Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 CI on October 11, 2026 (evidence below).
Neither establishes a supported Linux desktop release: installation, first-run setup and graphical
desktop behavior remain unverified. The current gaps are:

| Area | Implemented today | Missing for a Linux desktop release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tauri shell and package | Experimental Ubuntu 24.04 amd64 package build and extracted executable/desktop-entry checks passed; shared Unix shutdown code and external Python discovery are present. | Installation, startup, file dialogs and other GUI behavior still need native desktop verification. |
| First-run runtime | `scripts/install-openems-linux.sh` builds a CPU openEMS/CSXCAD environment from source for development. | `runtime/pins.json` has no `linux-x86_64` uv/openEMS entries; `runtime/setup-runtime.sh` accepts macOS arm64 only. The Linux source installer is not a packaged, relocatable managed runtime. |
| Updates | The Tauri updater plugin is installed. Upstream documents Linux AppImage updater artifacts. | `scripts/publish-release.mjs` accepts only `windows-x86_64` and `darwin-aarch64`; no Linux package/signature is published in the feed. |
| Optional sign-in | Guest mode is the default. | The opt-in accounts build uses Apple/Windows keyring backends; the Linux fallback is in-memory and does not persist sign-in ([ACCOUNTS.md](ACCOUNTS.md)). |

Start with **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64** as the first supported Linux desktop target. Ubuntu lists standard
support through 2029 ([release cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)). Tauri's current
Linux build prerequisites include WebKitGTK 4.1 and system development libraries
([Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)); openEMS has a separate native
dependency set ([openEMS requirements](https://docs.openems.de/en/latest/install/requirements.html)).
The desktop build dependencies passed on the Ubuntu CI runner; that job did not install or verify
the openEMS runtime. If publishing an AppImage for systems older than 24.04,
build it on the oldest claimed baseline: Tauri warns that newer build hosts can raise the glibc
minimum ([AppImage guidance](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/appimage/)).

Linux resource detection already accounts for process affinity and visible cgroup v1/v2 limits.
Usable CPUs are capped by the tighter of the affinity count and the visible CPU quota, rounded up
to at least one worker. Physical-core detection counts only allowed CPUs when affinity is available.
Available memory is the lower of host `MemAvailable` and visible cgroup hard-RAM headroom; swap
and reclaimable cache are not added to that headroom. The solver's default mesh cap is 40 million
cells; its approximate 90-byte-per-cell memory preflight warns above 60% and refuses above 90%
of the resulting available-memory estimate. The app observes affinity without changing it.

These behaviors are implemented in [resources.py](../python/fairbeam/resources.py) and
[linux_resources.py](../python/fairbeam/linux_resources.py), with mocked affinity, topology and
cgroup filesystem coverage in [test_linux_resources.py](../python/tests/test_linux_resources.py)
and [test_resources.py](../python/tests/test_resources.py). They are not evidence of a real
resource-limited container run. Limits above a delegated mount are invisible; unreadable or malformed
controls remain unknown rather than being invented. Missing cgroup data falls back to the known
host/affinity values, so resource protections cannot guarantee safety under hidden restrictions.

Recommended implementation order:

1. Install and validate a freshly built experimental Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 package on a desktop;
   CI has verified packaging only. Add a second Ubuntu LTS compatibility check after the first target works.
2. Add hash-pinned Linux uv and CPU openEMS artifacts, plus a Linux first-run/repair script. Build
   or assemble a relocatable openEMS/CSXCAD package with matching Python wheels and required shared
   libraries; the installed app should not compile native code or invoke `sudo`.
3. Choose the initial package format and wire its release/signature path. AppImage is the smallest
   fit for the existing self-update flow: Tauri documents `.AppImage` and `.AppImage.sig` as the
   Linux updater artifacts ([updater guide](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/)). Extend the
   release script for `linux-x86_64`; treat a `.deb` as a separate package-manager delivery path.
4. On a real Ubuntu desktop, verify a fresh install and runtime download, viewer startup, native
   file dialogs, a coarse CPU dipole run, cancel/quit process cleanup, and a signed update while
   confirming that the user's workspace survives. Keep the smoke run in a fresh temporary folder,
   use `--engine cpu --threads 1` or `2`, and leave the default mesh guard enabled.

The generic shell, runtime verifier, release-feed UI and resource preflight can be shared with the
macOS and Windows builds. Linux still needs native installation and desktop verification, distribution-specific
dependency checks, Linux runtime artifacts and a Linux update target before it can be called supported.

## Experimental desktop package build

`src-tauri/tauri.linux.conf.json` replaces the macOS bundle targets with a Debian package on Linux.
It keeps the existing application ID, version and resources, and disables updater artifact creation.
This is a developer package using an **existing external openEMS Python environment**, not a
self-contained Linux release. Managed first-run runtime installation, AppImage and Linux updates
are not implemented by this configuration. Do not combine it with `tauri.release.conf.json`.

On Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, install Rust and the [Tauri Linux prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
(including WebKitGTK 4.1, GTK 3, OpenSSL, libxdo, Ayatana AppIndicator and librsvg development
packages), plus `pkg-config` and `patchelf`. Then, from this checkout:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check:linux-desktop
npm run check:licenses
npm run desktop:build:linux -- -- --locked
# Inspect the developer package; this does not install it.
dpkg-deb --info src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/*.deb
```

The build command invokes the normal frontend build and writes the `.deb` under
`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/`. The `check:linux-desktop` command only checks configuration
contracts; it does not compile Rust, launch the shell or validate the package.

The manually triggered **Linux desktop build (experimental)** workflow in
`.github/workflows/linux-desktop.yml` uses Ubuntu 24.04, builds with the Cargo lockfile, inspects
package metadata and the extracted executable/desktop entry, and retains a seven-day Actions
artifact. It has read-only repository permissions, no push/PR trigger, no release upload and no
signing keys. It does not install openEMS, run simulations or exercise a graphical session.
An Actions build pass is therefore only packaging evidence, not desktop support qualification.

### Recorded package build

[Actions run 38099239648](https://github.com/ismailakdag/fairbeam/actions/runs/38099239648)
completed successfully on October 11, 2026. The downloaded `.deb` was hashed separately from the
Actions artifact ZIP.

| Evidence | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Source / runner | `bedfffc0b68adc46fda4a0bcdced60cc77202d83` / Ubuntu 24.04, amd64 |
| Package | `Fairbeam_0.7.2_amd64.deb`, 12,377,632 bytes |
| Package SHA-256 | `3BFAFC45C4EB433EF21B7DA4FABBCB5F864978B12B0C28A354051F94214B3C6D` |
| Build / notices | Locked Cargo release build, Debian bundling and license gate passed |
| Extracted package | `dpkg-deb` architecture `amd64`; executable `usr/bin/fairbeam`; one desktop entry with `Exec=fairbeam` |
| Linux Rust test | One reveal-path test passed: only an existing file's parent is passed as one literal argument; no file manager was launched |

The `0.7.2` filename is package metadata, not a new release of the `v0.7.2` tag: this source commit
is newer than that tag. The artifact is retained for seven days for developer inspection, not an
official download or updater target. This run did not install the package, launch its GUI, install
a managed solver runtime or perform a native EM simulation. The Debian source/runtime evidence
later in this document is a separate historical test.

For manual desktop verification, first prepare the CPU environment with the source installer
below. The shell can discover `~/opt/openEMS/venv/bin/python`; for a custom prefix, select its
Python in the setup screen. `FAIRBEAM_PYTHON` selects the browser launcher runtime, not the desktop shell. Use a disposable workspace and verify startup, file dialogs,
cancel/quit cleanup and resource discovery before trying a coarse solver run. Keep the existing
browser workflow as the tested source route until those checks have been completed.


The desktop Rust notices include the Linux x64 dependency graph; the workflow checks them before
upload. System GTK/WebKit libraries and the external solver environment remain distribution/user
managed. “Show in folder” opens the containing directory with `xdg-open` (the package depends on
`xdg-utils`); it does not select the file. Verify this on the target graphical desktop as part of
manual testing. Source/path tests do not establish file-manager integration.

## Requirements

- Linux with a C/C++ compiler and development libraries (Debian 13 x86_64 was tested)
- Python 3.10+ with development headers and `venv`; Python 3.12.14 was tested
- Node.js 22.6+ and npm for the viewer and repository checks; Node 24.19.0/npm 11.9.0 were tested
- Git, CMake, make, network access to the official GitHub sources and Python/npm registries
- A modern browser with WebGL for the viewer

On Debian/Ubuntu, review and run these system-package commands yourself:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake pkg-config python3-dev python3-venv \
  libhdf5-dev libtinyxml-dev libboost-all-dev libcgal-dev libvtk9-dev
```

The installer never invokes `sudo`, `apt`, or an upstream system-package installer. VTK's
package can bring additional dependencies; Qt/AppCSXCAD is not built by this setup. Other
Linux distributions need equivalent development packages; consult the
[upstream requirements](https://docs.openems.de/en/latest/install/requirements.html).

## Install and launch

From the repository root:

```bash
# Native CPU libraries and Python bindings, then this checkout's fairbeam package
scripts/install-openems-linux.sh

# Built viewer
npm ci
npm run build

# Viewer and Python API together; opens the local browser on an available port
scripts/run-linux.sh
```

The launcher uses the existing `fairbeam app` command, binds to `127.0.0.1`, and keeps the server
in the foreground. Stop it with Ctrl+C. Run `npm run build` again after frontend edits. Python
is installed editable from this checkout, so Python edits do not require a reinstall.

For a headless machine or a fixed port:

```bash
scripts/run-linux.sh --no-browser --port 5320
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5320 on the same machine
scripts/run-linux.sh --help
```

All arguments are forwarded to `fairbeam app`, including `--models`, `--projects`, `--jobs`,
`--sim-root`, and `--ui`. The default model/project directories are in this checkout; raw solver
output and job history use its `.sim` directory. See [RUN-SERVER.md](RUN-SERVER.md) for details.
The server runs your Python models with your account's permissions; it is not a Python sandbox.

### Custom paths and an existing installation

```bash
PREFIX="$HOME/opt/fairbeam Linux" SRC="$HOME/opt/openems Linux sources" JOBS=2 \
  scripts/install-openems-linux.sh
PREFIX="$HOME/opt/fairbeam Linux" scripts/run-linux.sh

# Or select an existing interpreter with working openEMS, CSXCAD and fairbeam imports
PREFIX="/path/to/openEMS" FAIRBEAM_PYTHON="/path/to/venv/bin/python" \
  scripts/run-linux.sh --no-browser
```

Installer settings:

- `PREFIX`: native libraries and `venv/`; default `~/opt/openEMS`
- `SRC`: cached upstream checkout and build directories; default `~/opt/openems-src-linux`
- `PYTHON`: interpreter used when creating a new venv; default `python3`
- `JOBS`: native compile parallelism; default 2, or use 1 for a low-memory machine
- `CC`/`CXX`: compilers; default `gcc`/`g++`

An existing importable `PREFIX/venv` is reused without rebuilding or upgrading openEMS/CSXCAD.
A normal installer run still installs Fairbeam from the current checkout. An invalid existing
venv is rejected before native files are written. If the venv is valid but the native bindings
cannot import, the installer rebuilds the native components and may replace their installed
files; choose a new `PREFIX` and `SRC` to preserve an older installation.

A source checkout at a different upstream revision, one with tracked changes, or a CMake cache
for another install prefix is left alone and rejected; choose another `SRC`. Reusing build
caches across prefixes can retain the older library paths. For a clean rebuild, choose both
a new `PREFIX` and a new `SRC`.

The installer builds fparser, CSXCAD and openEMS individually, then their Python bindings. New
builds use the pinned upstream revisions below; Python dependencies come from the configured pip
registry and are not locked. Both scripts add `PREFIX/lib` and `PREFIX/lib64` to
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, preserving any existing value. When running the Python CLI directly with a
custom native prefix, use the same library path if imports cannot locate the shared libraries.

## Minimal verification

The first check is read-only and does not download, install, simulate or launch a server:

```bash
scripts/install-openems-linux.sh --check

# Set PREFIX here if the installation is not in the default directory
export PREFIX="${PREFIX:-$HOME/opt/openEMS}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PREFIX/lib:$PREFIX/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
# The suite expects the default mesh limit, not a user-provided override
env -u FAIRBEAM_MAX_CELLS "$PREFIX/venv/bin/python" -m unittest discover -s python/tests -q

# One small CPU simulation; writes only into a fresh temporary folder
smoke_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
"$PREFIX/venv/bin/python" -m fairbeam run python/models/dipole.py \
  --set mesh_div=10 --points 101 --end-db=-30 --threads 2 --engine cpu \
  --name linux-smoke --out "$smoke_dir/projects" --sim-root "$smoke_dir/sim"
printf 'Smoke results: %s\n' "$smoke_dir"
```

Run simulations one at a time. This deliberately coarse dipole is a runtime smoke test, not a
mesh-converged accuracy benchmark. Repository frontend checks are described in
[FROM-SOURCE.md](FROM-SOURCE.md#tests).

## Tested configuration and limits

Tested on September 30, 2026 using Fairbeam source commit
`d3de9af23b6d8c31295387b346e395d46707d6e6` and the following official upstream sources:

| Component | Tested revision/version |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie), x86_64 |
| Python | 3.12.14 |
| Compiler / CMake | GCC/G++ 14.2.0 / CMake 3.31.6 |
| openEMS-Project | `9f5cdd4d71cae312633ab0b2c1db64867f8c782b` |
| openEMS | `5b1ecb1244e6bd192d83efdf2bc84e5f83c96047` (`v0.37.0-rc3-16-g5b1ecb1`) |
| CSXCAD | `bd2c133392d93251b640da1f8e2367163f00b7f5` (`v0.7.0-rc3-1-gbd2c133`) |
| fparser | `4b9c845b449b520c4b8c5f23c74cd04820084f81` |
| Native dependencies | Boost 1.83, HDF5 1.14.5, VTK 9.3.0, TinyXML 2.6.2, CGAL 6.0.1 |
| Python dependencies | NumPy 2.5.3, h5py 3.16.0, Cython 3.3.0, setuptools 84.0.0 |
| Frontend tools | Node 24.19.0, npm 11.9.0 |

The test did not use system packages: the Debian development/runtime packages were extracted into
a local directory, with their paths supplied through `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, a test-only
`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`, compiler flags and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
The final installer completed an end-to-end build in initially empty source and runtime
directories, both containing spaces, in 177.4 seconds. This included cloning the pinned
upstream sources, compiling all three native libraries and both Python bindings, creating a
venv, installing Fairbeam and checking imports. The ordinary apt-installed dependency layout
on another host has not been tested separately.

The installer's reuse path also passed, including bootstrapping missing `pip` with venv-local
`ensurepip`. Five regression tests verify read-only checks and rejection of invalid venvs or
build caches for another prefix before native files are written. Launcher path/argument
handling, including a relative venv interpreter, passed. The launcher served the built viewer
and answered local health/API checks, then stopped cleanly.

The 100,842-cell CPU dipole smoke run converged after 7,200 timesteps with two threads. It took
13.8 seconds wall time and about 101 MiB peak process RSS, with S11 about −37.6 dB at 2.4 GHz,
maximum directivity 2.19 dBi and radiation efficiency 98.17%. These figures describe that run,
not a performance guarantee.

The final freshly installed runtime repeated the same smoke in 14.9 seconds, converged at
7,200 timesteps, and matched the original S11/impedance arrays within relative tolerance
`1e-8` and absolute tolerance `1e-10`. Its launcher also passed health, UI-file and result-bundle
HTTP checks and shut down cleanly.

`npm run build` (including TypeScript checking), `npm run check:designer`, and
`npm run check:exports` passed. The build reported an oversized main-chunk warning and
mixed static/dynamic import warnings.

Direct imports and geometry export also passed. A full Python suite run with the default mesh
limit completed 799 tests in 146.3 seconds: 778 passed, 20 skipped and one failed. The analytic
dipole `DipoleTest.test_moment_method_reference` predicts a resonance near 2.53 GHz, outside the
expected 2.42–2.47 GHz interval; its MoM matrix is numerically rank-deficient (99 of 100 at
2.44 GHz). This analytic reference is a known open issue.

The manual browser fixture and `npm run check:scenarios -- --skip-run` could not start a browser in
this configuration, so no app browser assertions, graphical interaction or WebGL rendering pass is
claimed. Native Tauri packaging was not tested in that September 30 source run; the later Ubuntu
CI packaging evidence above is separate. GPU acceleration, installed desktop behavior, other Linux
distributions/architectures and official Linux release delivery remain unverified.
