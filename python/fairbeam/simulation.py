        The NF2FF box records time-domain dumps, so the transform works at any frequency after the
        run. openEMS' Prad is the Poynting flux through the box surface (nf2ff_calc.cpp), which
        does not depend on the angular grid: on the patch example Prad came out bit-identical from
        3°/5° down to 90°/180°, and the transform of 21 frequencies took 2.3 s on the 3°/5° grid,
        0.9 s on 5°/10° and 0.27 s on 90°/180° (the floor: reading and transforming the dumps).
        So the grid (``EFFICIENCY_THETA_STEP`` / ``EFFICIENCY_PHI_STEP``) is the coarsest that
        spans the sphere: θ 0, 90, 180 and φ 0, 180. Its own ``outfile`` leaves the
        pattern's ``nf2ff.h5`` alone. Prad is mirror-corrected as for the pattern; Pacc is the
        port's accepted power interpolated at each frequency.

        Reliability (``pacc_error``, ``reliable``): away from the match the port reflects almost all
        of the incident power, and Pacc = Pinc (1 - |S11|²) is a small difference of two large
        numbers. Stopping the run at the end criterion truncates the ring-down, which leaves an
        error of about the same absolute size at every frequency, so there the ratio is ill-
        conditioned: the patch starter's efficiency zig-zagged from 15 to 85 % at -50 dB and was
        smooth at -60 and -70 dB, with Prad within a few % in all three (docs/BUNDLE.md#efficiency).

class LossyMetal:
    """A metal of finite conductivity, used like a CSXCAD property (``AddBox``, ``AddPolygon``, ...).

    openEMS has no single property for it: a conducting sheet (``AddConductingSheet``, a surface
    impedance model of a thin conductor of the given conductivity and thickness) works on 2D
    primitives only and falls back to PEC on anything else, and a volume needs a material with
    that conductivity (``kappa``). So each primitive goes to the property its shape needs: sheets
    (a box flat in one direction, a polygon) to a conducting sheet of ``thickness``, or of
    ``drawn_thickness`` when it is set (a thin brick built as a sheet keeps its drawn thickness; an
    extrusion thinner than ``sheet_limit`` becomes a sheet of its length), volumes to a material,
    and wires and lines to a perfect conductor (a conducting sheet cannot
    hold them). The first property takes ``name``; any further one ``name`` plus a suffix, so a
    part with sheets and volumes shows as several parts in the bundle, each with its ``conductor``.

    A volume's loss is only right where the mesh resolves the skin depth (about 1.3 µm for copper
    at 2.45 GHz), which an antenna mesh never does; there the volume behaves almost like PEC.
    Printed copper is best drawn as sheets (the default thin-metal build does that)."""
