"""Design files: a model described as data instead of Python (``<id>.design.json``).

The visual designer in the viewer edits these files; everything else (``fairbeam run``, the preview
worker, sweeps, the optimizer, jobs) treats them like any model, because :func:`module_for`
returns an object with the same ``MODEL`` / ``PARAMS`` / ``build`` interface as a model module
(``fairbeam.model.load_model`` calls it for ``*.design.json``).

The geometry maps one to one onto CSXCAD primitives, the same ones Python models use::

                                     "frequencies": ["f0"]}]}  # optional: E/H maps on cut planes
    }

``monitors.currents`` records surface-current maps on the metal sheets at these frequencies, as
``fairbeam run --fields`` does; the build sets ``Simulation.current_freqs`` and ``fairbeam run``
honours it when no ``--fields`` flag is given. ``monitors.efficiency`` ({"points": N}, 3 to 201,
default 21) adds the radiation efficiency at N frequencies across the band (bundle
``results.efficiency``), post-processed from the far-field box after the run. It needs the far
field; the build sets ``Simulation.efficiency_points``, as ``fairbeam run --efficiency N`` does.
``monitors.field_planes`` (up to 4 planes of up to 4 frequencies each) records the magnitude of E or
H (``quantity``; ``component`` "abs" (default), "x", "y" or "z") on a plane normal to ``normal`` at
``position`` (mm) across the whole domain (fairbeam.field_planes, bundle ``field_planes``); the
build sets ``Simulation.field_plane_monitors``, as ``fairbeam run --field-plane`` does.

``model.conversion`` (optional, informational) records how a design was made from a bundled
example (fairbeam.example_design): ``{"source": "patch-antenna.json", "notes": [{"code":
"meshLines", "text": "...", "values": {...}}]}``. The designer shows the notes in Properties, in the
interface language (``code`` and ``values``); ``text`` is the English sentence. The build ignores it.

Units: lengths in mm, frequencies in GHz. Every number may instead be an expression over the
parameters (``"W/2 + 0.5"``, ``"wavelength(f0) / 4"``), evaluated by a small safe evaluator (no
attribute access, no calls other than the whitelisted maths functions; plain decimal numbers).

Primitive kinds (simple modelling shapes, each one maps to one CSXCAD primitive):

``box`` (a brick)
    ``start`` / ``stop``: the x, y, z minimum and maximum (the designer shows Xmin/Xmax, ...).
    Zero thickness along exactly one axis makes a sheet.
``cylinder``
    Axis form: ``axis`` (x/y/z), ``center`` (the two in-plane coordinates, in CSXCAD's order: axis
    z -> [x, y], x -> [y, z], y -> [z, x]), ``radius`` (outer), ``inner_radius`` (0 or absent:
    solid) and ``range`` ([min, max] along the axis). A solid one is CSXCAD ``AddCylinder``, one
    with an inner radius (a tube) ``AddCylindricalShell``. The older form ``start`` / ``stop`` /
    ``radius`` (axis end points) is still read. A ``range`` with min = max is a **flat circle** (a
    ring with an inner radius): a sheet, built as a regular polygon (:func:`disc_ring`: vertices on
    the circle, an even number of sides keeping the edge within ``DISC_SAG_MM`` of the arc, at least
    ``DISC_MIN_SEGMENTS``); a ring is two half rings (:func:`disc_halves`), since CSXCAD polygons
    have no holes. A zero-length CSXCAD cylinder would carve nothing, so none is ever built.
``sphere``
    ``center`` (x, y, z) and ``radius``: CSXCAD ``AddSphere``.
``polygon``
    flat, on a plane ``normal`` = x/y/z at ``elevation``; ``points`` are in-plane coordinates in
    the same order as a cylinder's centre.
``linpoly``
    a polygon extruded by ``length`` along its normal.
``cone``
    Axis form like a cylinder: ``axis``, ``center`` (two in-plane coordinates), ``bottom_radius`` at
    ``range[0]``, ``top_radius`` at ``range[1]`` (0: a sharp cone). CSXCAD ``AddRotPoly``: the
    trapezoid (radial, axial) turned about the axis, moved to the centre by a translation.
``torus``
    ``axis``, ``center`` (x, y, z), ``major_radius`` (axis to the tube centre) and ``minor_radius``
    (the tube): CSXCAD ``AddRotPoly`` of a regular 64-gon (``TORUS_SEGMENTS``) turned about the axis.
``wire``
    a thin wire: ``points`` (a polyline of x, y, z points, at least 2) and ``radius``. With a radius it is built
    as a solid: a flat-ended cylinder along every segment and a sphere at every bend (:func:`add_wire`; CSXCAD's
    ``AddWire`` snaps the line to the mesh edges and resonates a dipole 15 % low), so the mesh needs cells about as small as
    the radius; the automatic mesh refines the free ends and the surface lines. A radius under 0.02 mm, or a wire with a
    slanted segment, stays CSXCAD's wire (a bare line of mesh edges).

``polyhedron``
    a closed solid from ``vertices`` (x, y, z points, at least 4, expressions allowed) and ``faces``
    (lists of vertex indices, at least 3 each and at least 4 faces): CSXCAD ``AddPolyhedron``.
    CSXCAD rasterises triangles only, so the build fans every polygon face into triangles
    (:func:`polyhedron_triangles`) and orients them by the enclosed volume, so a mirrored copy
    still builds. Transforms move the vertices.

A part may carry ``transforms`` ("transform with copies"), applied in order to all of its
shapes and expanded exactly when the design is built (every copy is a real primitive)::

    "transforms": [{"type": "translate", "copies": "N - 1", "step": ["pitch", 0, 0]},
                   {"type": "mirror", "plane": "x", "keep": true}]

``move`` shifts every existing primitive by ``offset`` (three expressions, in world coordinates),
without adding copies: ``{"type": "move", "offset": ["dx", 0, "h"]}``.
``translate`` adds ``copies`` copies, the k-th shifted by k x ``step`` (the original stays);
``mirror`` reflects across the axis-aligned plane ``plane`` through ``point`` (a three-expression
vector defaulting to [0, 0, 0]), keeping the original unless ``keep`` is false. ``scale`` takes
positive uniform ``factors`` and an ``origin``; zero copies applies the scale once, while a positive
copy count keeps the original and adds cumulative scaled copies. Nonuniform scaling is rejected
because it cannot represent every supported primitive exactly.
``rotate`` takes ``axis`` (x/y/z), ``center`` (three expressions), ``angle`` (degrees, any value an
expression evaluates to) and optional ``copies`` (default 0). Zero copies rotates the original; a
positive count retains it and adds copies at k x angle, k = 1..copies. Quarter turns remap axes
exactly for every shape. Any other angle keeps the shape's own exact local form and attaches the
rotation as a CSXCAD affine matrix (nothing is replaced by a bounding box or tessellated); the
meshing and the bounds follow the rotated shape. Two things stay refused: a zero-thickness metal
sheet tilted off the Yee grid (:func:`sheet_transform_issues`: rotate it about its own normal, or
give it thickness) and a live Boolean operand rotated off the axes.

Ports are ``lumped`` (openEMS LumpedPort: ``R``, a probe or strip between ``start`` and ``stop``
along ``direction``) or ``waveguide`` (openEMS RectWGPort through ``Simulation.waveguide_port``:
one TE_mn ``mode``, "TE10" by default, of a rectangular guide with the broad wall ``a`` along
axis (direction + 1) % 3 and ``b`` along (direction + 2) % 3; ``start`` / ``stop`` span the guide
cross-section, the excitation in the ``start`` plane and the mode probes in the ``stop`` plane).

A part may carry ``cuts`` (a boolean subtraction for flat sheets: slots, U-slots, E-shapes, inset
notches, clearance holes). A cut is a rectangle given like a sheet brick (``start`` / ``stop``,
min = max on exactly one axis), a round hole (``"kind": "circle"``: ``normal``, ``elevation``,
``center`` in the plane's in-plane coordinates, ``radius``; the regular polygon of :func:`disc_ring`)
or a polygon (``"kind": "polygon"``: ``normal``, ``elevation``, ``points``). It is subtracted from
the part's flat sheets in the same plane (rectangular sheets, polygons, flat circles), before its
transforms. CSXCAD polygons cannot have holes, so the build replaces each cut sheet by the exact
difference: disjoint rectangles when only rectangles cut a rectangular sheet
(:func:`_sheet_minus`), else polygons clipped in 2D (:mod:`fairbeam.polyclip`; a hole leaves its
surround as several polygons). Cuts remove area, not volume: a solid the cut plane crosses is left
whole (a check says so)::

    "cuts": [{"start": ["-ws/2", "-ls/2", "h"], "stop": ["ws/2", "ls/2", "h"]},
             {"kind": "circle", "normal": "z", "elevation": "h", "center": [0, 0], "radius": 2}]

Thin metal: a metal brick much thinner than the mesh can resolve (PCB copper, 17 to 70 µm) is
built as a zero-thickness PEC sheet (:func:`thin_sheets`), so the mesh gets no cells of the copper
thickness and the timestep stays reasonable. The limit is a tenth of the finest cell the automatic
mesh aims for (λ at f max / cells per wavelength / √εr of the densest dielectric). The sheet sits
on the face that coincides with or touches a dielectric (the substrate side), else in the middle;
port and resistor ends inside the drawn thickness move onto it. The bundle keeps the drawn
thickness for display and the exports. ``"mesh": {"thin_metal": "volume"}`` keeps the volumes of plates at least 0.6 of the finest cell thick
(:data:`VOLUME_COST_FACTOR`); thinner ones are still sheets there, because cells across them would make the timestep
more than 5x smaller and the run never end.

Lossy metal: a metal material with ``"conductivity"`` (S/m, e.g. 5.8e7 for copper; empty or absent =
PEC, as before) builds its sheets as openEMS conducting sheets of ``"thickness"`` (mm, default
0.035; a thin brick built as a sheet keeps its drawn thickness) and its volumes as a material of that
conductivity (:func:`metal_loss`, ``simulation.LossyMetal``).

A part made by a Boolean operation in the designer (add, subtract, intersect, insert, #80) carries
``booleanHistory``: the operation and its operands A and B (whole parts, with their cuts,
transforms and nested histories). Operands are bricks, rectangular sheets, polygons (flat, or
``linpoly`` extruded along their normal) and curved shapes (cylinders, tubes, cones, spheres, tori, wires,
polyhedra). Its ``primitives`` are the result at the design's own values: Add and Intersect of boxes are boxes (the
exact box partition); Subtract (and Insert) of bricks and polygons is as compact as it stays exact, the fewest shapes
of ``linpoly`` / ``polygon`` primitives (a rectangle that comes out of bricks is a brick; a sheet minus a volume uses
the volume's cross-section at its plane) or the part kept whole with B as a cut-out (a pocket); an operand's round or
polygon cut, or its cut-outs of bricks and polygons, are folded in first. Otherwise ``linpoly`` / ``polygon`` primitives (every polygon must share one
normal: the operands are cut into slabs along it and each slab is clipped exactly in 2D by
:mod:`fairbeam.polyclip`; a hole leaves its surround as several simple polygons, since CSXCAD polygons
have none). With curved shapes (:mod:`fairbeam.boolean_curved`): Add keeps all shapes (bricks and polygons
united), Insert keeps A whole (the designer lifts B above it), Subtract keeps A and adds B's shapes as
cut-outs (``"void": true``, vacuum above the part, see below; a cylinder minus a coaxial cylinder or tube is
exactly a tube), Intersect is exact for coaxial cylinders and tubes, trims by a brick, cylinders along a
common polygon axis (clipped as 64-gon prisms, the native cylinder when the clip leaves its ring) and
shapes inside a brick, and refuses the rest with the combination and what to do instead. When ``live`` is
set, the build recomputes the result from the operands at the values it builds with
(:func:`boolean_primitives`, the same arithmetic as the designer's src/designer/booleanParts.ts and
polygonClip.ts), so sweeps and optimisation follow the operands' parameters. The Python export
writes the result at the default values.

A primitive with ``"void": true`` is a cut-out: the build makes it vacuum (eps_r 1; a property named
"<part> (cut)") with the priority of its part's solid shapes + 0.5 (or its own ``priority``), so it erases
what has the same or a lower priority inside it. Priorities may be fractional; the build ranks them to
integers only when one is (:func:`build`).

A part may carry a ``component`` path (component folders), e.g. ``"antenna/feed"``: the
designer's tree groups parts in folders by it. The build and the exports ignore it (the Python
export keeps it as a comment).

Errors are :class:`DesignError` and carry the JSON path of the offending field (``where``), so
the designer can point at it. The checks against absurd but buildable states (a port in the air,
a brick with min > max, ...) are in :mod:`fairbeam.design_checks`.
